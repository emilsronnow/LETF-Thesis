Commodities,Investing,1njforb,Should I diversify 10% of my long-term portfolio into gold or a global ETF?,neq1750,"Vanguard’s VEA is actually “international” which is defined as “non-US”, while IShares ACWI is truly global large-mid cap (at 0.32% ER).  Vanguard has their all-cap global etf VT  at 0.06%, while State Street has a less popular all-cap global SPGM at 0.09% that’s more concentrated than VT but usually has better returns (price and dividend).    I’d love ACWI at a VT expense ratio, but one reason it’s more expensive reportedly is it tracks its index better = attracts traders. 

Now iShares URTH is global developed, so it will invest in an index with the US, Europe, Japan and other long term capitalists countries, but leave off China, India, and smaller recent capitalistic coin.  It does have some stocks that support the emerging mkts but are domiciled in the U.S. ~ less than 1% last I checked. 

Vanguard’s VEA is all caps developed ex-US with a cheap er but their VEU is all world ex-US large-middle cap with still some small-cap stocks.  Another possibility if wanting to leave off China, India, etc.. but keeping South Korea is Schwab’s SCHF at just a tad more er for a large to mid-cap etf.  There’s VXUS or IXUS with more small caps, but personally having only 100 mostly U.S. stocks in QQQ vs the 3,400 to 4,400 stocks in IXUS or VXUS kind of seems unbalanced to me (but YMMV).  Also Fidelity offers an all-cap version of QQQ with the symbol ONEC though it, and actually QQQ itself, may double down in a few minor %-wise international stocks like the Netherlands tech foundry maker ASML (not necessarily a bad thing).",1758123886.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1njforb/should_i_diversify_10_of_my_longterm_portfolio/neq1750/
Commodities,Investing,1njforb,Should I diversify 10% of my long-term portfolio into gold or a global ETF?,neqfs8e,"Great questions. For long-term diversification, I'd lean towards the global ETF (ACWI or VEA) over gold. Gold doesn't generate returns like equities and is more of a volatility hedge. A world index gives you broader exposure and potential growth. As for timing, trying to time the market is usually a losing strategy. If you're truly planning a 10-year hold, dollar-cost averaging now might be smarter than waiting for a perfect pullback. Your QQQ is tech-heavy, so a global ETF would provide nice sector and geographic balance. Personally, I'd do 10-20% in ACWI and keep the rest in QQQ.",1758128063.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1njforb/should_i_diversify_10_of_my_longterm_portfolio/neqfs8e/

Commodities,Investing,1njforb,Should I diversify 10% of my long-term portfolio into gold or a global ETF?,nepufqt,"Honestly, putting 100% in QQQ is super concentrated, so thinking about adding diversification makes sense. If you’re planning to hold for a decade, I’d personally lean toward adding a global ETF like URTH or ACWI, it gives you exposure to markets outside the U.S. and different sectors that might outperform at different times. Gold (like GLD or IAU) is more of a hedge; it won’t grow much, but it can reduce volatility and help during market stress. You don’t have to go all-in at once, maybe start with 5-10% into the global ETF and see how it feels.

Commodities,Investing,1njforb,Should I diversify 10% of my long-term portfolio into gold or a global ETF?,neq74jc,"It depends on your age and risk tolerance. You are averaging 18% return with QQQ over 10 years with a relatively high downside risk at these valuations.

Gold pretty much makes no sense. It's all time highs. Bonds are paying close to 4%, which basically matching golds annualized returns over 10 years. The debt crisis is at least 5 years away, so USD treasuries are still pseudo risk free.

Global ETF will likely mirror SPY500 since most of the SPY are global companies. You'll see a huge correlation here, so not really a hedge against anything.

I think it makes sense to diversify, but I wouldn't sell anything. I would start moving future allocations into bonds and being ready to deploy the capital if the market corrects.

Commodities,Investing,1n7neh4,Gold no sweat investment ?,nca0e39,"This. Gold isn't meant to be your MAIN investment. It's a non-productive asset. 1oz of gold in ancient Rome or ancient China will buy you a nice artisan suit just like it would buy you a nice suit in 1900, and just like how a nice tailored Italian suit or an Armani suit would run you around $3000~. The gold isn't getting more valuable but the dollars you normally hold are getting devalued by government printing. 

Stocks and bonds should be the BnB. I personally prefer productive assets over non-productive ones as my BnB but I also believe that different asset classes/vehicles offer true diversification (per Ray Dalio). If you folks want gold or PMs then great but anyone should buy into them no differently than they would VOO. By that logic, I would suggest DCA into it. 

Some folks like Ray Dalio will argue for more gold, but remember that Dalio is a HEDGEFUND MANAGER and his All-Weather Portfolio is built to HEDGE against downside while providing consistent returns (rather than seeking outsized returns against the S&P500 or outperformance against any particular benchmark)

p.s. My job LITERALLY involves the sale of precious metals. I have not reason to lie to ya'll. I bought in a bunch during 2020-2023.

>The interest rate of an FRN is the sum of two components: an index rate and a spread.

>**Index rate**. This rate is tied to the highest accepted discount rate of the most recent 13-week Treasury bill. We auction the 13-week Treasury bill every week, so the index rate of an FRN is reset every week.

>**Spread**. The spread is a rate we apply to the index rate. The spread stays the same for the life of an FRN. The spread is determined at the auction when the FRN is first offered. The spread is the highest accepted discount margin in that auction.

>The index rate plus the spread equals the interest rate.

>We apply the interest rate to an FRN's par value every day. Thus, the FRN accumulates interest earned every day.

It’s like spending $1000 on a go-bag. You may never use it but the peace of mind is priceless. Except in this case you get peace of mind, and will retain a large portion of the investment. People are failing to treat this upcoming disaster put in terms of a natural disaster.


If there was a 20% chance of a category 5 hurricane hitting your house, you’d buy the go-bag. Except in this case it’s a go bag that you can re-sell at a later date for likely a higher value. 


The alternative is instead of buying the go bag, you bet your money on the hurricane NOT hitting, so that you can potentially get 5-10% more money that what the go-bag resells for, but even this can go tits up.

My positions: roughly 10% euro index, 10% SK, 10% Nikkei (JPN), 12% euro defense, 10% SH (inverse SPY), 20% INTC (bag holding since $25 2022), 10% FLUOR (Probably a bad call but they have a decent balance sheet), the rest ~10-15% in volatility/option plays (this is prior house money and the % gains on this money has been like 60% so far).",1745103004.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1k326zd/hedging_against_global_chaos/mo03o5z/

Your portfolio is about 66% stock w/ overweight to international. And instead of bonds you are holding notable amount of gold and FX.  I agree that there is risk that USD may continue to decline, but should note that cheapening of USD doesn’t help foreign countries trying to sell goods to US in times of tariffs. So I doubt other countries will actively look to sell USD and US bonds. While there is a risk things will really fall apart for a while, it is very difficult to time that right and then get back reinvested as market recovers.  FED has ammunition to combat near term economic decline and so a deep recession is probably not the likely scenario.  I personally prefer: if you have $100 to invest, invest $10 a quarter over the next 2.5 years ($cost average). By then, if shit hits the fan, Republicans suffer in the mid term elections and Trump becomes a lame duck. And things will get sorted out one way or another.   But otherwise, good luck to you.

If I may offer: it might be controversial to say cuz Vanguard is popular, but SCHY is possibly a stronger choice than either VEA or VGK over the long run. Perhaps stronger than least some of the others as well. 

It’s a bit more expensive at 0.08%, but it offers coverage of every ex-us region, similar to VEA. Pays a higher dividend, than both. And has stronger fundamentals plus a bit lower volatility than both. 

I’m not a Schwab shill so to offer another potentially solid option could be TLTD. Unfortunately, the expense on this one is much higher. However, Seems to offer fundamentals as strong as SCHY. Also offers a higher div, wide regional coverage.

To cover small and mid-cap with rhe same qualities, FDNC pairs well any choice imo. 

For regions you feel underweight in, specific etf like AFK and FBRL might be worth a look.

It sounds like you should be investing into international equities, instead of an unproductive rock. International stocks are priced incredibly fairly (15.6x P/E ratio), and therefore should turn a profit in foreign currency. If the dollar depreciates, that would directly benefit you, since you'd earn won, yen, euros, etc. which would exchange for more dollars (meaning a larger return). So, you would make money even if the dollar doesn't depreciate, but if it does, that would be in addition to their inherent productivity.

There's great evidence to suggest that heavy international diversification (50%) produces the greatest long-term benefit for retirement, and I'm guessing you are way under 50% international allocation.",1744504824.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jxr23b/yesterday_i_bought_ishares_gold_trust_iau_an/mmtllrn/

**Recommendations**

1. Increase Savings:
   * Try to increase contributions by 1% of salary each year
   * Take full advantage of any employer match increases
   * Consider additional catch-up contributions when eligible
2. Portfolio Optimization:
   * Consider consolidating overlapping positions
   * Add VNQ for additional real estate exposure
   * Maintain current asset allocation but simplify holdings
3. Risk Management:
   * Gradually increase bond allocation as you age
   * Consider target date funds for automatic rebalancing
   * Review and rebalance annually

**Will You Be OK?**

Based on your current trajectory, you're on track for a comfortable retirement, but with some caveats:

1. You need to maintain or increase current contribution levels
2. Consider increasing savings rate as income grows
3. Stay invested through market cycles
4. Keep expenses reasonable in retirement

The good news is that starting at age 30 with 37 years until retirement gives you plenty of time to build wealth. Your current portfolio structure is solid, though it could be simplified. The main focus should be on increasing your savings rate over time while maintaining broad diversification.

Remember that this analysis assumes consistent contributions and returns. Regular reviews and adjustments will be necessary as circumstances change.

There's a reason the US stock market has absolutely TORCHED the international markets.  Do not fall victim to short termism and recent headlines.  

US capital markets are still far and away the most efficient, least regulated, and it's not even remotely close

By the way, all large and mega cap US companies do business all over the fucking world.  In fact, most of the mega caps have more than 50% of their top line being driven by int'l expansion.  Absolutely no reason to go purchase int'l funds that have 1-2% exp ratios when the companies inside SPY are all doing business overseas and maintaining international exposure themselves

Commodities,Investing,1jgg8xu,Critique my portfolios - will I be ok?,mizhpuf,"oh absolutely diversification is key, but you don't diversify by buying a billion index funds. just one is enough. diversification, as i am advising here, is just investing in all equities (ill keep bonds to the side for now) at their market cap weights. so aapl at its % of market cap, bhp at its % of market cap.

that means that \*the one and only\* ""TOTAL MARKET, MARKET CAP WEIGHTED, GLOBAL EQUITY INDEX FUND"" (memorize that lol) will hold pretty closely to \*every available stock on the planet, at its own market cap weighting\*.

if you really like gold, hold it ig, i mean i would recommend you switch it out for bonds. but if you really like it, maybe like 5% of portfolio max.

why did i choose vti over voo? they both are actually pretty close, but voo only holds the top 500 us stocks, while vti includes the us extended market. that is actually closer to a ""total market"" index (when you hold it with vxus ofc)

btw, if you hold vti/vxus, but then you add on a random fund after that, do you notice how you concentrate a bit in the stocks of the fund? cuz you are already holding microsoft stock for example through vti at its market cap weight, but if you buy a tech etf you would hold more msft than the market cap weight.

so basically, peak diversification is when you hold every stock at its market cap weighting (with a few exceptions) and you don't deviate from that weighting. that's why we just vti/vxus or vt and chill.

check out ben felix on youtube for how diversification works and why you should do it.",1742569773.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jgg8xu/critique_my_portfolios_will_i_be_ok/mizhpuf/

 I get the semis (although I think there's other things out there; TSM yes, AMD for a bounce fine but earnings have to start to get more impressive than they have been.)

Yes.

ETFs are a simple and cheap way to get excellent returns. Stick to low cost broad market ETFs that track an index the more boring the strategy the better. Just stick with VOO or VTI and some international exposure like VXUS.

Commodities,Investing,1ionci4,What am I missing with my current investment strategy?,mclgr8o,">Over the long term 90+ percent of the wall Street teams of geniuses with PHDs and algorithms fail to outperform the market.

This is a big oversimplification that ignores the significant disadvantages that affect large funds even if they have all the ""geniuses"" on them. With a fund comes liquidity constraints as well as diversification/position sizing rules and regulations.

Large funds also cannot capitalize on market inefficiencies in the same way a retail investor can. As an example, if a multi-billion dollar fund recognized a smaller cap stock that was significantly undervalued, they couldn't take advantage of the opportunity because the money it would bring to the fund would be negligible to shareholders as well as liquidity slippage.

>The best investment strategy is to chase market returns in exchange for market risks.

Not necessarily. It depends on your goals and how much risk you can tolerate.

>If you want that, then you just buy the market and be done with it.

What would be considered ""the market""? Which funds specifically? There are many different index funds and ETFs, all of which follow different benchmarks.

>You'll have years where you do incredibly well and you get to feel all smug about those, but the 10~20+ year track record is where you get to eat humble pie.

There are plenty of funds/investors that have outperformed indexes. The average might not, but there are known examples such as Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, Mohnish Pabrai, Terry Smith, Chuck Akre. The list goes on.

That when put in a portfolio it can perform when others assets do not and the rebalancing effect can benefit a portfolio. Few things offer the free lunch diversification benefits. Small caps have a large correlation with SP500, so does international and emerging markets, and even real estate, so that's where gold can also perform.

I'd still rather have the institution custody the actual gold because while I acknowledge the callability, holding physical gold has it's own idiosyncratic risks and I hold it for it's properties as an asset that offers useful diversification.",1730681211.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1giofp5/physical_gold_etfs_and_counterparty_risk_from/lv9vb7h/

To me, not investing into the biggest potential asset is actually the riskier move.

Commodities,Investing,yzgrag,Why is gold down with such high inflation?,ix0hsr7,"This is from a Bloomberg interview with John Paulson on Frothy US Housing Market (“This Time Is Different“, Bloomberg, 25. September 2022). 

He also talks about gold (excerpt below), I share this opinion 


Q: Can you help us understand what’s happening to gold now? Will it keep dropping?  

A: One thing about gold is that it’s down this year, more or less 8%. It’s down a lot less than stocks or bonds. So it has proven to be a source of protecting wealth. The issue is gold’s a hedge against inflation, but while the current inflation rate is high, long-term inflation expectations are still very low. It’s like 2.5%. And they haven’t really changed while the Fed has been raising interest rates. So as the 10-year yield has gone from 2% to, let’s say, 3.6%, inflation expectations still are around 2.5%. So before real rates were negative, now they become positive. So because real rates have become positive, that’s really put a cap on gold.
I think what needs to happen for gold to become more responsive is if the Fed ultimately raises rates, the economy weakens, and they pause. And then they see they can’t control inflation. Then it’s not going to come down to 2%, at best. Maybe they get it down to 4%, 5% or 6%, and then the economy weakens, they have to ease again. And then inflation comes back. At that point long-term inflation expectations will rise. People will not believe the Fed can control it. And then I think gold rises to higher levels.",1668888641.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/yzgrag/why_is_gold_down_with_such_high_inflation/ix0hsr7/

Commodities,Investing,yzgrag,Why is gold down with such high inflation?,ix0eblr,"Sure, and I don't disagree with you (I happen to think gold can be a useful component for risk-averse investors to mitigate portfolio volatility simply due to its usual uncorrelation to both stocks and bonds), but by this logic, *any* asset that has beaten inflation over the long term - which ironically is all of them (even T Bills!) *except* broad commodities - can be called an ""inflation hedge,"" with stocks being the best one. I actually explained in a recent video how there's no such thing as a true ""hedge"" for inflation and that if you're a young investor with a long time horizon and you own stocks, your portfolio is already covered for inflation.

Gold and other commodities are simply stores of value and means of production. They are not value-producing assets. They have no interest, dividends, or cash flow. Thus we wouldn't *expect* them to generate a positive real return over the long term. Their short term utility is, again, arguably a different story, depending on one's time horizon and risk tolerance.",1668887146.0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/yzgrag/why_is_gold_down_with_such_high_inflation/ix0eblr/

Um, compare what a dollar buys today compared to what it bought 100 years ago.  Looks like it's failing to me.  The same thing happened in the Roman empire.  Currencies don't die overnight but all fake currencies eventually die.

My post is accurate.  Gold and silver maintain their value over time.  Can you buy a loaf of bread today for 10 cents?  No you can't.  Can you buy one with what you could sell a silver dime for today?  Yes you probably could.

1 oz of gold has always been able to buy a nice suit.

My understanding is that Canadian market is not the biggest and a bit cyclical.

Until recently bonds + equity was seen as suboptimal, that may have changed with higher rates now. Not sure where Canadian Central bank is with rate hikes.

Emerging Markets is historically more risky, gold is historically less risky.

What I am potentially missing is MSCI World, or some other exposure to developed markets ex US.

The other thing not present is REITs (less risky) and Commodities (more risky).

One big advantage of a portfolio like this is that rebalancing it i.e. annually leads to reduced risk. Are you planning to rebalance this going forward?

I'm very different in my style of investing because I'm only working in the <$100,000 amounts for now, but personally I am expecting a sideways market, not an up or down market for the next few years. But, my strategy is one that keeps me in about 60-80% cash generally, but yields (so far because I'm either lucky for the past 4 years or a decent stock picker) about 20% annually.

1. I do a f-ton of DD and macro research and probably spend waaaay too much time studying business, sometimes 20+ hours a week while working 40+ hours a week on top of that...
2. I buy low and sell ""high"". Sounds so simple, but I calculate using my own assumptions exactly what I think a stock is worth at any given time (including the macro environment) and when it's below that value say 5-10%, I plow anywhere from 5-10% of the fund into it (or multiple if there are many opportunities). 
3. Any investments that rise above 1% return in under 2 weeks I sell, any that rise above 2% in a month, I sell, you get the idea.
4. Any investments that fall, I buy into (DCA), maxing at about 30% of the fund. Then it sits, until we rise above that expected 1-2% a month return, which for the past four years, including covid, only takes anywhere from a few more days to max 3.5 months so far. 

The end result of this strategy is that I typically have slightly higher taxes (costs about a percent a year, so 25% is 24% returns), stay mostly in cash, typically match or beat benchmarks if I had instead put the entire fund into S&P500 or VTI, etc. (the most I've ever been invested with this strategy to date was in april 2020 at about 87% invested).  


Anyways I expect this to be downvoted and not listened to, but I would argue if you are a decent researcher and good at valuing a company or group of companies, you should easily be able to invest 15-20% of your money in high conviction plays and expect to get 6-8% returns every few months, and average about 3% or better annual returns on your whole fund, while only exposing that amount of your fund. The rest I would put into any debts you have and then honestly a 2-3 year CD yielding something like 0.6-0.8% annually. Better than nothin and lowest risk I can think of while still using decent exposure.",1626058188.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oihf8r/best_way_to_hedge_against_inflation_given_these/h4vo02u/

For example, if you expect inflation to be 5%, but a crash of 50% drawdown is possible at any moment in time, 10% of cash per year into index funds DCA'd might be a good hedge.  This (somewhat) balances inflation risk with market risk.

If stocks go up an additional 10% this year, you'll get 1% on your total portfolio.  If you can find another 1% for the rest of your cash, you are set.

Or for a 50% investment-grade bond (slightly higher than 10Y yield), 50% stock allocation, with a 33% crash, that would be about 15% of cash DCA'd per year might be a good hedge.

Commodities,Investing,oihf8r,Best way to hedge against inflation given these assumptions... 2021,h4yqjno,"""Dollar would be unattractive because inflation, no? I mean, the premise for a correction is that inflation stays high, right?""

Inflation is pretty much everywhere the same. Also during the big correction on stock market, dollar tends to spike up shortly. It happens because investors sells stocks in panic and naturally exchnge them to dollars, so you have demand peak on this currency. TLT have similar tendency during stock crisis.

I think in long term USD is going to be weaker, as US are shifting more and more towards socialism, higher taxes, which screws the business, etc. Also at some point dollar is no longer going to be the world-wide currency used for international deals. Once China's military will be big enough they'll stop using USD to buy oil, or something, but this is just my bet...

""And EM are still dealing with Covid in a much larger way... Though that might make it a good place to stick money if you're looking longer term. Hmmm...""

I think the same. If EM has problems, it means they're cheaper. CAPE of EM is way more reasonable to me. Not long-long though, mybe up to 10 years. EM and developped markets tends to outperform earch other once every 10 years. 10's were US's decade. It's time for EM now?

There is saving for retirement and then there’s saving for your great grandchildren. I can understand this potentially for large endowments as their all weather portfolio but for an individual, it just seems silly.

It isn’t even hands off enough that you can just use it as an all weather without worrying, since you’d still need to manage it over time.

Vol goes up and vol goes down and if you just roll the straddles you ride the vol up and back down with Theta nibbling at it all the time.

You might want to consider setting a rule where you don't buy vol when VIX is above a certain level, that way you can cash out when it's high and buy in again when it's low. 

You might also want to set a point to sell. In the book ""Tail Risk Hedging"" Bhansali runs through scenarios with a protective put about 10% OTM. Generally, if you hold to expiry, this is a long term losing strategy. But if you set a profit point (such as 500%) and sell at that point, it is a long term profitable strategy, especially if you use your profits to buy equities at this point.

1. It continues to drop after you sell
2. You rebuy before it rises above the price you sold at. This can be difficult if the market recovers in jumps (see the 7% days we had back in March) or if you believe it will drop again shortly (which may not happen).

No. The issue that I have is that I think young people (if this sub is any indication) have become increasingly risk-averse despite having long-term time horizons.

This also involves actually calling it right, which I didn't do in May when I thought growth was overextended. Thankfully only sold a little and re-deployed the money not that long after.

I don't own index funds, largely own individual names. What I focus on is what I want to own 3-5 years from now; things that I think are going to be increasingly relevant, that have a durable growth path, etc. If there is a rotation out of growth into value (which I would fully expect if there is a rotation out of growth), it doesn't change wanting to focus on what I want to own 3-5 years from now. I don't want to sell something that I want to own for 3-5 years and have a low cost basis in to buy something that I'm not really confident for 3-5 days or 3-5 weeks and then try to figure out where to get back into the thing that I really wanted to own for the long-term in the first place. 

Sometimes I will take a little profit and wait to redeploy, sometimes I will de-emphasize some themes and emphasize others. I became more aggressive in March and April and dialed up aggressive growth names at that point and I may dial those down a little bit at some point.

Commodities,Investing,hj7gjo,"1 - Wednesday Morning Thoughts - Short, Medium, and Long-Term Focus Points",fwocdi2,"Glad you appreciate it.

My personal positions are certainly risk averse, but I'll try to explain my positioning briefly below:

Gold is absolutely a haven asset which is generally a shield against downside risk in an average diversified portfolio; however, this is a very unique set of circumstances which I believe makes gold a **must have** in any portfolio, and in my opinion should be *overweighted*.

Given the extraordinary level of money printing across all CBs in major economies, it is not surprising that many analysts and economists are expecting inflation to come eventually. If/when this inflation arrives, it will be quite bullish for gold regardless of how high inflation goes (we do not need the doomsday hyperinflation that extreme pessimists expect for gold to increase significantly in value, nor do I expect hyperinflation to occur). Given that we are in a state of QE infinity right now in the US and the Fed will be keeping rates *at least* this low until 2022, I would say inflation is all but certain down the line.

On the other end, in a deflationary environment which some are worried about given certain circumstances, gold **still wins** as it becomes a store of value which people will flock to as companies struggle to pay down massive accumulations of debt that may become impossible to service due to a rising value of the dollar. This scenario also lends itself well to gold as it is now the *next best asset* to hold for yield over an extended period. Normally this would not make sense, but since bonds across the board now have extraordinarily low yields and ROI for these assets would be abysmal relative to just staying in equities, any risk-off sentiment is likely to drive gold higher than it would before because there is no longer a high-yield alternative to equities that is ""safe"" by investing metrics, even though gold is a non-yielding asset.

This makes a gold a must have for me and is the reason it is my only long term holding: **it doesn't matter if I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow, the case for gold is bullish regardless of near term volatility and market swings**. I have no long term holdings in other industries right now because I feel the industries (think tech) that have benefited most from the rally have become the ""pain trade"" of 2020 - that is, they have become crowded by traders and investors because they were the only clear winners among abundant uncertainty. I would not say that I am ""expecting the worst"", more that I am waiting for this crisis to really play itself out to see where the *true opportunity* is and where there is the possibility for greatest value.

Not sure if you're young (you said you're a new investor), but try to think about the COVID crisis like the financial crisis in '08: after Bear Stearns went under, many banks famously came forward and said that their balance sheets were strong, Bear Stearns was an isolated incident and they believed the worst was over. ""**Crisis cancelled.**"" Lehman Brothers was infamously among them. The crisis had really just started and nobody realized just how bad things really were at the time. That seems eerily similar to the sentiment right now, to me: some companies have declared bankruptcy and unemployment is sky-high, but this is a black-swan event, it will pass and things will return to normal so long as the Fed has our back. ""**Recession cancelled, virus cancelled.**""

I fully expect even some more beat-down industries to experience their own resurgence, but I'm waiting until the dust settles to see how things shake out. You're not wrong, in fact you're seeing things how most investors are looking at this. I hope this helps, let me know if you have any other questions.",1593678573.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hj7gjo/1_wednesday_morning_thoughts_short_medium_and/fwocdi2/

To fill you in Im mid 30s and have recently done well from my recent entry to the markets but am certainly fearing that this rally can't go on for too much longer.

I think there are many new retail investors like myself who are certainly at risk of believing that they are smarter than the market, solely because they have ridden a nice wave these last few months. Am I right in thinking that the downside risk is too great and that this ""dumb money"" needs to start thinking about balance as opposed to the high growth that has done them so well already?

Commodities,Investing,hj7gjo,"1 - Wednesday Morning Thoughts - Short, Medium, and Long-Term Focus Points",fwpx2yd,"As the saying goes, *""Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.""* If one thing is certain right now, there is a hell of a lot of greed in markets right now driven by a lot of inexperienced investors. Many experts have actually compared retail trader/investor activity in 2Q20 to the Dot Com bubble in 2000 and 2001. I agree with them strongly on this comparison, and think it's important to remember that there is *a lot* of money on the sidelines right now, particularly on the institutional side. Market prices are about where they were prior to the COVID crisis (at least for large-cap companies, particularly those in SPY and many tech companies traded on the NASDAQ), and many analysts and investment professionals believed that valuations were high *before* we had a massive economic shock. This observation has not been forgotten by institutions with billions on the sidelines right now, and I believe once the reality of economic health sets in a little more firmly and a correction ensues, there will could be more liquidity shocks driven less by increased selling pressure and more by a lack of demand for these companies viewed by institutions as being mispriced. When the Fed held a press conference in June and reiterated that the economic recovery could be an extended process, that simple reality (that really should not have been a surprise to anyone) was enough to drive the S&P 500 lower by over 100 points and drive VIX up 40% in a single day. In my opinion that could be an indication of how little desire there is to buy into equities at their current valuations.

The good news for us is that we're young and we have plenty of time until retirement, so near-term shocks and downturns shouldn't impact our ability to retire comfortably unless we're haphazardly investing every spare cent the entire time. Given the monumental uncertainty between now and 2021, I might not allocate my money into anything else outside gold and rebalance post-election. My short-term indicators I'll be watching will really only guide some swing trades I make after hours, as I won't feel confident parking my money anywhere long-term until fundamentals start working their way back into equity valuations.

Regarding your inquiry about ""balance"" in investing versus targeting growth stocks, refer back to what I said about the 2020 ""pain trade"": *everyone* crowded into these stocks, as they were often the best-positioned stocks to perform well given the crisis being faced. This was due to the ""TINA"" principle, which is to say ""there is no alternative"". Not everyone wanted to park their cash in one place, but there was no better option with interest rates near zero, bond yields at record lows and QE infinity by the Fed to provide a backstop to equity prices. Once opportunities arise in other industries, equity prices will begin correcting in certain areas that have been crowded (think tech) and you may see price surges in industries that have been depressed (think airlines in recent weeks). This is why I want to do that research now: to figure out where the value will be once the dust settles.

For reference: I am in my mid twenties with a fair amount of savings, and I actually have very high risk tolerance. I have roughly $30k on the sidelines right now, $8k in gold holdings and about $60k in long-term Vanguard funds covering large, mid, and small-cap stocks. I will not touch the $60k in Vanguard funds until I retire, and intend to manage the ~$40k myself actively.

**tl;dr**: Don't count on dumb money becoming smart, rather DCA into the market during pullbacks. If the SPY sells off 100 points again in a single day, throw some of your money at it and let it ride. You'll likely get burned timing a bottom like everyone else who didn't buy into the March lows, and with there being very few alternatives to earn a good ROI in the market right now, it's difficult to advise moving your money elsewhere. Gold is certainly my favorite asset right now, but I'll hopefully have some more insights after this weekend that will include new holding recommendations. I don't think we'll re-test the March lows with the Fed as a backstop for markets unless, and I can't stress this enough, **everything goes to hell**. And unless Yellowstone erupts, I don't really see how things could get much worse in the near-term. Mid-long term is more concerning to me.

If you want to participate in the market but are worried about downside risks, you could always buy protective puts on your assets as well to limit your losses. Premium will be high so long as vol remains high, but if it helps keep your mind at peace about your investments it's absolutely worth the cost.

Commodities,Investing,ggzrj3,Gold for the next few months?,fq5m3i7,"""Volatility will come back over the next few months as we see the full economic impact and get a look at future earnings.""

You're already getting plenty of looks at earnings. You're already having plenty of discussions on conference calls. This sub has thought for almost two months that literally all earnings would be bad and that would be when the market would tank again. Not all earnings are bad - there are winners and there are losers; you are hearing companies that are talking about adoption of their products/services being pulled forward by *years.* If you take the view that ""everything is bad"" then you're going to ignore opportunities. Twilio has earnings, stock goes from $120 to $180 in a couple of days. Fastly +40%, Teladoc up big since this started. Shopify more than a double since early April and - to my surprise and I'm very long the stock - continues even higher after earnings. Paypal has earnings and the stock is down 3%, the call starts and the company is so positive the stock goes up 13-14% the next day.  This whole approach of being 100% pessimistic - people just missed a lot of opportunities during this as it's becoming clearer and clearer (and you're hearing it on earnings calls) that in many cases, adoption of technology or various other things (digital payments, remote work, online grocery, telehealth and other things) has been pulled forward considerably by this. Themes that may really see broad growth well after this. 

""With nowhere else to go, investors will flock to gold.""

I think gold will probably do well but this mentality that ""all earnings are going to be bad and commentary will be bad and everything is bad"" has just been completely wrong.

Commodities,Investing,g928u3,What do you think of my modification of Ray Dalio's All-Weather Portfolio?,foquprk,">Dalio's public All-Weather portfolio is 30% stocks, 40% long term treasuries, 15% intermediate term treasuries, 7.5% gold, 7.5% commodities. 

This is more a ""Tony Robbins All Weather"" portfolio. I suggest reading the [real](https://www.bridgewater.com/research-library/the-all-weather-strategy/) thing so you get a good understanding of what the aim of risk parity is. Technically the portfolio should be rebalanced based on asset correlations and volatility.

Having said that, your idea to use ultra-long treasuries is a good one for retail investors to get faux leverage. Although by choosing this part of the yield curve, you are implicitly betting that the curve will not steepen. You may want to invest in TIPs if you feel there are inflation risks.

I would avoid BDCs as they seem to combine the bad sides of equities and treasuries i.e. they suffer during downturns but also suffer from higher interest rates. Often their investments are illiquid and they're difficult to track. 

Also be wary with backtesting over the last 12 years since investors have to be forward looking. Your sole equity exposure to S&P 500 suggests this since they outperformed small caps and internationals. These periods of outperformance tends to move in cycles. So I would replace the BDCs and VFITX with a general international fund like VTWSX and then you can manage other equity exposures.

>Instead of adding stocks, I will add leveraged middle market debt instead, specifically Business Development Companies (BDCs).

What you are suggesting here is basically just increasing your weighting towards a deflationary market environment.

The entire point of having gold and commodities in here is that they at least hypothetically balance out the risk of inflation vs. deflation in the portfolio. Since you're effectively just leveraging the deflationary side of the portfolio even more, you are just drastically increasing your risk to long-term inflation.

&#x200B;

>Because these funds zig when equities zag, we can increase the amount of equity-like exposure in our portfolio.

So what happens when this stuff doesn't ""zag"" when the market ""zigs""? You end up with a huge loss because you've levered up on stuff with the assumption that a correlation will always hold. 

Not saying this isn't something that can be profitable, but you should at least know what you're getting yourself into and ***why*** you would want to balance inflation risks in an all weather portfolio in the first place.",1588009731.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/g928u3/what_do_you_think_of_my_modification_of_ray/forc59n/

I would not recommend holding this until retirement, if you're 28.

I would suggest you backtest this for much longer periods of time. The last 12 years have seen mostly low and falling long term rates.

What's going to happen to your ultra long duration bonds if we enter a rising rate, inflationary period, at any time in the next 30 years?

One way to back test further is to look at PRPFX, which is a mutual fund holding 25% each of cash, stocks, bonds, and gold. It does okay, but stocks have crushed it, since the time it was created.

Even that one is hard to backtest, because it starts in 1982, which is the start of the current cycle of high rates going down to low rates:  
[https://www.multpl.com/10-year-treasury-rate](https://www.multpl.com/10-year-treasury-rate)

You really want to look at something starting in the 50's or 60's, as low rates went to high. Try to figure out the right mix of stock, bonds, and gold to navigate the next 30-40 years if something like that happens again.

I suspect the answer is:  
Don't go all in on stocks today, because there might be more downside to this recession.  
Bonds might give a little more upside if this recession gets worse.  
Do try to be fully invested in stocks by the end of this recession.  
Hold until you're retired.

Your proposed 20% VTSAX instead of 20% BDCs led to very similar portfolios, except that the BDC portfolio still yielded about 1.5%/year more for a comparable amount of volatility.

When when the credit sours, their share prices crater 50%, much like the stock market does. So, my BDC allocation gives not only an average return of 9% per year, but also a \*consistent\* 9% per year while things are going well.

If it is the case that most BDCs underperform and you're backing yourself to pick the best BDCs then I would assume you'd be able to pick the best performing stocks too.

Other assets that seem to follow an equity-like exposure you may be interested in: mortgage REITs, preferred stock, private equity, corporate bonds, senior loans. USMV/low vol is also a good idea. If you want oil exposure, you may want to deal with USD/CAD as a proxy since they don't experience contango. 

My view is general asset classes like domestic equities and fixed income (specifically treasuries) can be blended to give you the risk profile of other assets like BDCs, corporate bonds etc. 

I've been running a risk-parity portfolio for the last 20 years but with a lot more leverage using futures. I tend to focus on sector rebalancing during economic cycles. I also care about the yield curve. IMO ultra-long treasuries are best right now given the steepness of the curve.",1588009638.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/g928u3/what_do_you_think_of_my_modification_of_ray/forbyao/

I would definitely not be basing my decision on technicals. It has bounced, certainly, but remains a highly discretionary purchase in a time where I'd be a little cautious on that.

Also, I wish people would stop listening to Ray Dalio like everything he says like it's gospel when he says something different every other week and has been decidedly wrong multiple times in the last couple of years. He also continues to promote the hell out of that book from a few years ago. 

Also: 1) if you're a young person, trying to build an all weather portfolio with 55% bonds is not a good idea 2) You're not really building an all weather portfolio with random stocks.

Young people on here yield chasing (which has lead to buying shit like mREITs before they got obliterated) and two, building their own all weather portfolio (this isn't the first post about this) - young people (which I'm guessing OP is) being way too conservative because of concerns over the short-term rather than focusing on the long-term.

The airlines want something like a $50 billion bailout. They spent $45 billion in stock buybacks (which is used to increase the value of stock grants given as executive bonuses) over recent years. Bailing them out is not going to be a politically popular.

US cruise ship companies fly foreign flags on their ships in order to avoid paying US taxes and having to follow US regulations (environmental, etc.). Bailing them out is not going to be politically popular either. Also, cruises aren't a necessity to the functioning of our economy like flight is.

You've taken a high stakes gamble. My money would be on companies that are down -30% but that aren't financially distressed and have great outlooks coming out of this.

For you, I recommend sticking to DCA passive index investing, such as $SPY.",1584881201.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fmuvbt/if_there_is_a_bailout_for_the_airline_and_cruise/fl6rou7/

I think there used to be a PP ETF but I think it closed, I can't google it now.

The thing with PP returns is that while it does provide a low-volatility ride to returns close to 100% stock portfolios, it does so by going flat for years at a time, followed by explosive growth for a while.

Also, Harry Browne's design and a lot of present day back testing looks pretty good due to the secular bull market in bonds from 1982 - 2010, during which treasury rates declined from 15% to what they are today. Falling interest rates cause rising bond prices, much more so at the long end of duration, meaning that long term treasuries provided some pretty spectacular returns over the period... in fact I think I read somewhere that $10K invested in long term treasuries in 1982 actually outperformed $10K invested in the S&P 500 over 30 years.

That's a screenshot of American Airlines' balance sheet from their last quarterly report (10-Q). I've circled a few things - cash and cash like assets at the top. That totals $5.6b. Then, their total 'current assets' (which includes the above) - that's $9.5b.

Moving on down, we see they have $19.5b in current (i.e. short term, due soon) liabilities. For every $1 in short term assets they have, they have $2 in short term debt. For every $1 in cash they have they have $3.5 in debt. That's not counting long term debt, when you throw that in you get $1 in assets for every $6.4 in debt.

So let's say the planes all stop flying the day after this report came out. That debt's still there, you don't get out of the leases. They have $5.6b in cash compared to $61b in debt. Not pretty. More to the point, they have $5.6b in cash vs $19.5b in debt that's \*due soon\*. Sure, they have 9.5b in \*total\* current assets, but a lot of that is tied up in accounts receivable (i.e. people who owe them money and might not pay, given dire enough straits) and stuff like fuel and spare parts.

Based on your age, I would say, 10-20% Money Fund, 30-40% Government Bond ETF and 50% SPY is a reasonable conservative portfolio

You can google correlations among asset classes to have a better picture

The underlying math: the variance of portfolio equals to the sum of weighted variance of each assets plus the sum of weighted covariance. And the covariance is calculated based on correlation times the two standard deviations of two assets",1570310150.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ddshad/investment_strategy_during_volatile_market/f2mzjb2/
Commodities,Investing,ddshad,Investment strategy during volatile market,f2nes5j,"Might help to dive deep into asset allocation and portfolio construction theory. 

Your proposed allocation really reminds me of the golden butterfly portfolio:

https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolio/golden-butterfly/

That website is so interesting because it backtested data (realize that the past doesn't dictate the future) and compares returns and volatility of various professionally developed portfolios. 

Personally, a few months ago, I rebalanced to a 60/40 equities/bonds allocation across all my accounts and have over 13+ months of expenses saved in VMFXX. 

We will see increasing volatility as the global economy continues to contract. 

This link from Vanguard shows historical average annual returns based on different asset allocations. 

https://personal.vanginsights/saving-investing/model-portfolio-uard.com/us/allocations

Over the long term, 60/40 produced annual average returns of 8.6%.

I say this knowing we may very well be about to enter a recession. If we do (definitely an if), I am not expecting it to be bad enough for a massive gold spike.

Once again, I take you back to recent examples. What type of ""money printing"" are you talking about? More QE? QE is not inflationary. It inflates some asset prices and produces deflation elsewhere. History has proven this over 2 decades. 

Are you talking fiscal spending? IF so, then yes, this is inflationary, but we would need to account for what happens when interest rates rise off their lower bounds. Inflation in this instance would heavily benefit borrowers, but it would come at the cost of creditors. With an enormous amount of credit expanded with the advent of ultra low rates (think European banks lending out at 1% interest rates), what happens when inflation rises off that zero bound? You start getting massive hits to the creditor institutions as they go from not very profitable, to taking massive credit risk with just a small rise in inflation.

In the end, you would get small bouts of inflation / stagflation until it would inevitably cause creditors to start to freeze up, resulting in bigger losses from them.

With expansionary fiscal policy, you 100% can see inflation, but we would need a lot more deleveraging before it can actually become any type of long term trend.",1565106341.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cmfgo8/thoughts_on_buying_gold_and_longterm_treasuries/ew4aaki/

None the less, I try to tell myself, if I could go back in time 5 years ago, and give myself advice, I probably would have told myself to purchase stocks, either outright, or dollar cost averaging, and just hold tight and keep working. Had I done that, yes the declines in 15/16 would have been gut wrenching, but I would be sitting pretty now in more cases than not. So, why not take the same approach now, so that in 3 to 5 years, I can tell myself, ""be glad you held through the noise""

I'd lower the (once again this is personal opinion) BND allocation to 2.5%-5% if you do want a bond portion and raise the VNQ portion (I treat REITs like these as, specifically, high yield bonds. Riskier but you can make more money, and since you're young and your earning potential is high as hell right now you can definitely handle the risk but that's just me).

Add emerging markets like SCHE (Schwab's emerging markets index which is trading much cheaper than Vanguard's right now) if you want larger exposure and a bit more risk to your portfolio.

Commodities,Investing,8j45h4,Seeking some quick advice on an ETF portfolio,dyyk74x,"I think you're approaching it the right way, but it could be argued that you shouldn't invest taxable, until you're working through / maxing a Roth, at least, so you're in a kind of loop of thought, you know? 

Ideally, you should have your own retirement account / plan (Roth IRA) and then additionally whatever employer benefits come along (401k). I don't think any directly participate in funding Roths, but I may be wrong, that sounds almost dreamlike, heh. 

Roth IRAs you can keep through any job like a bank account. 401ks or deferred comps. start through individual employers.

So, to get around to your question, you don't have to gun for a retirement fund now, if you're thinking you're going to draw down from this investment at some point over the next few years, which can be likely as a young person. But, it might be a good idea to consider a Target Date retirement fund (through Vanguard, etc.) if you just want to get the ball rolling for retirement.

Maybe make like every paycheck go: 10% savings, 10% retirement, everything else fun, school, needs, etc. and taxable investments. ",1526307319.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/8j45h4/seeking_some_quick_advice_on_an_etf_portfolio/dyyk74x/

There's a bunch of issues with investing in these as a retail trader. For starters because of regulations the portfolios hold no commodities or virtually none. In a macro book there's a lot of value in trading energies and metals in a volatility breakout /momentum portfolio. Without those you're basically trading rates and equities. This ends up being a more or less 2x long stocks bet.

Secondly the fees are so large because of the nature. I have a portfolio. I have a marketer. Some platform has a sales person. That platform has a marketer. You thr investor pay. Us. All. It's super high fee. Don't bother.

Commodities,Investing,4wzse2,What happened to gold in 2008 ?,d6bejd9,"First, you shouldn't listen to the mainstream media on the topic of gold. They either don't know what they are talking about or are outright lying.

When the market tanks, you've got a lot of people who need to cover their positions, especially when margin calls start happening. Gold is one asset to go, especially due to its general liquidity in comparison to something like real estate. So it sells off and the price goes down with everything else, but it also recovers faster as people start piling into the safe haven assets.

Gold is more of a hedge against the dollar and the financial system itself than stocks. Gold isn't tied to any of it, and importantly has no ties to debt. You can see this year that gold and stocks are going up in tandem, so they aren't negatively correlated. The rise in gold from 2008-2012 had much more to do with QE and general fear than anything else. I would speculate that gold is rising now due to zero-bound/negative interest rates in the bond market as well as general uncertainly/fear. When fiat money has no yield but is still inflating supply, gold becomes much more attractive.

Also financial products that are tied to gold aren't really a good thing to look at (or hold) as a hedge against the system, since they are themselves within the system. If the stock market crashes you could very well see all financial ""gold"" products, stocks, etc crash with it, while physical gold remains stable, or at least rebounds faster. It all depends on what the nature of the crash is.

That's not to be harsh, but it's simply the idea of, I'm writing what I'm writing on here - which is a fair amount already. I'm not a moderator, either, although I offered on a couple of occasions when they asked for new ones recently. 

I'm not going to go into my whole portfolio on here; I'm not directing this towards you but I just feel like there's so many posts about ""What do I buy?"" that there's too much of copying what other people are doing already. I have gone into detailed discussions on a number of things I own (data center REITs, Visa, Ecolab, Danaher and others) here in the past. I'm not going to go over all of the positions and then have people try to copy without an understanding of the investment, time horizon and other factors that went into the decision. At the same time, I don't have the time or desire honestly to write a thesis on everything I own.

I'm a very big believer in people generating their own ideas because I think it's really one of the core tools of investing that you have to have. You cannot just go off of what randoms on the internet are doing because you're offloading your decision making onto someone else, who isn't necessarily going to be there to tell you when to buy or sell. 

That said, broad philosophies:

1. No fads/trends. I am okay with not getting involved in fads or trends. This is particularly true in things like the apparel industry. I do not want to own a Lululemon (LULU) because eventually the housewives in yoga pants will move on to something else or other companies in an industry with little in the way of barriers to entry will muscle in. Lululemon over the years has also offered many examples of what I call ""stupid drama"". I hate drama in investing, but I particularly hate stupid drama. The idea of investing in a company who promoted their clothing to contain seaweed and it didn't contain seaweed makes me so mental my eyes cross. Does this mean that I will miss out on some things? Sure. I'm okay with that. I have enough ideas on other things that interest me that I'm okay with missing out on things I don't care about.

2. Value consistency and reliability/quality management. The idea that there is value in consistency of companies who have delivered year in/year out for many years. Danaher (DHR) is an example of this. Fiserv (FISV) is another. Outstanding management that cares about creating shareholder value is of such key importance and I think that's why it makes me a little nuts to see how much discussion is devoted to things like Twitter and GoPro on here - two companies that have done an exceptional job at destroying shareholder value.

3. A broader/different approach. People on Reddit love Ford and yet, rather than investing in one manufacturer, I can point to a dozen broad plays (ORLY, VLEEY, ALV, AZO, LKQ, etc) that have either outperformed or massively outperformed Ford not only for the short but long haul. People can invest in social media companies, but I preferred to look at data center REITs, which basically exist at the intersection of all manner of trends - social media, mobile gaming, e-commerce, streaming video, etc - and chose to invest heavily in companies who I thought were essentially providing the infrastructure for these themes. Not only have the stocks done exceedingly well, but I can sleep well at night because I'm getting pretty decent dividends from all of them in the meantime and reinvesting those dividends.  People invest in T and VZ and those are fine, but rarely do I see discussion of investing in American Tower (AMT) or Crown Castle (CCI) and both of those cell tower REITs have rewarded shareholders quite well in recent years. People jump to T or VZ when they think of data and that's fine, but there are other players who own infrastructure assets. There are multiple ways to approach a theme or industry. People can look at the TBTF banks like JPM, but financial tech provider Fiserv (FISV), which deals with the industry broadly has massively outperformed JPM over the short and long haul. Fiserv isn't cheap by any means at this point, but I'd still rather own that than BAC or JPM. Thermo Fisher (TMO) is a picks-and-shovels play for the medical/research industry broadly. There are other examples. I'd rather Visa (V) as a broad play on consumer spending than a lot of individual retail names. 

4. Recurring revenue. I do look for companies with highly recurring revenue. Take Ecolab (ECL) for example, where a large part of their business is consumables that have to be repeatedly reordered. The company has a largely predictable, razor/blade business model and focuses on needs for its customers that range from water management to food safety and more, dealing with everything from local grocery stores to giant multinationals like Hyatt (who do hotels often call when they have a pest problem? Ecolab) and Budweiser. The company is considerably larger than the next largest competitor. Is Ecolab something I'd add to now? No. Is Ecolab ultimately something I can see owning 10 years from now? Yeah. Thermo Fisher (TMO) is another recurring revenue example, as is Fiserv (FISV), although again, would I add to either of those here? No. Can I imagine owning them years from now? Absolutely. I will wait for better opportunities to add.

5. Moat. I do not invest in companies that I do not think have a moat. That means avoiding some things entirely and I'm okay with that.  It's all a matter of what allows me to invest in a manner where I can be less concerned about the day-to-day and I don't like companies where someone else could do the same thing tomorrow.

6. Needs/tangible assets. I do tend to focus on companies that I believe address a need. That's certainly not the broad focus, but I do focus on things like healthcare, like infrastructure, like agriculture and other things that address day-to-day needs (see Ecolab.) I own Zoetis (ZTS) - people are going to take their pets to the vet and farmers are taking care of their animals. I see owning Zoetis for the long haul, but again, not something I'd add to here.  Another focus is tangible assets - real estate, infrastructure, railroads and the like. 

7. Dividends. Not everything I own provides a dividend and I do not limit myself to owning only dividend payers. Most do. As someone is long-term in their view, I do like reinvesting over time and have a large focus on dividend growth, as I like to broadly look for a balance of growth and income with my investments broadly.

8. Themes. Simply the idea of what do you believe will be relevant themes in the next 5 years? A lot of my investments fall under one of several broader themes that I feel strongly about.

9. Interest/focus. I invest in what interests me. What interests me may not interest you and that's okay. Finding what a company does compelling (or better yet, fascinating) makes it much easier to enjoy the homework and add when opportunities arise if the fundamentals remain the same.  What I own are ""best ideas"" (and again, my ideas certainly may not be yours and that's okay.) I will sit and look at 300 companies and maybe find 1 or 2 out of that that I add to my shopping list. As I get older, the filter has become much more difficult to get through. I don't own anything that ""sounded sorta interesting"" or ""seems pretty good."" It's either I have very strong confidence in where the company is headed and where the industry is headed or I'm not investing. 

10. Valuation. Is the company trading at an attractive valuation?",1468537182.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4sso3m/why_are_both_everything_is_awesome_and_panic/d5cly76/

The leverage is something crazy like 532-1 paper gold to real gold. So meanwhile physical will stay highly sort after while the banks continue to manipulate the price of gold to deter people from acquiring it and to make more money of course. A lot of people are probably thinking, no surely that can't be legal. Ponzi schemes are only legal if banks and governments are running them.

Commodities,Investing,31n2eh,Advice on building an ETF portfolio for long term,cqb5sv0,"If you're goal is to simplify, is there any reason you haven't liquidated your TD Ameritrade account and just moved it into IB? That will make the re-balancing less onerous.

Can you rebalance your SIPP? If you're goal is to simplify, then I'd probably reduce sector exposure overlap between accounts (Henderson Emerging Markets is serving similar exposure to VWO).

Are any accounts tax-advantaged? For simplicity, tax-advantage accounts can insulate you from dividends reporting if they are reinvested (at least in the US). Tax-advantaged accounts may also cut you off from a potential loss-harvest stream.

If the goal is passive, diversified long-term exposure then I'd think to make sense to expose to these sectors:

* Nominal Bonds
* Inflation Linked Bonds
* Equity, US
* Equity, Euro-asia
* Equity, Emerging Markets
* Real Estate
* Inflation-hedge

It seems like a lot of the complication for you comes from:

* Overdiversification of equity ETFs; you can hold something like VTI for US, VEA for Eurasia and VWO for EM (or the appropriately domiciled equivalent). You can slice out to growth, small/mid/big cap if you like -- but not if you're goal is to simplify.
* Holding similar exposures in different accounts, meaning that if global equity markets move, you are rebalancing across everything.

Some other things to consider:

* BND is short-term; if this is a long term investment, you could consider longer duration ETFs like EDV/TLT.
* GLD is really an inflation hedge, but you could try to take that on more directly with GSG
* What about target-date funds?

Commodities,Investing,2zxwei,Gold - advice on investment,cpnbjp7,"Actually, it was the steady climb in gold prices that made me invest. I think about 4 or 5 years ago, we had gone to purchase some gold necklace for my wife when the price was around $1150 per ounce. We went back six short months later and then found that the price went up to $1350 or higher. And a few more months later it spike to $1600. So, I thought I was a smart aleck and made the dumb mistake of investing heavily in gold. Then I made a much bigger and dumber mistake of NOT bailing out when the prices started dropping. Only now I realize that investing in MF's and stocks one needs to be an active trader and I am not sure that the ""buy and hold"" philosophy holds good any longer. i bought smaller volume of stocks in a bunch of oil companies a few years ago and now they are all getting beaten thoroughly. So, it seems to me that the concept of a safe haven is not going to hold true. Another example: I was thrilled to buy BABA at $87 a pop when the market went down consecutively on 3 days and now I am waiting to get the heck out of that position because BABA went up to $112 and now it is somewhere around $85. I hope that it goes to 90 or 95 so that I can get out...fast.
Luckily, unlike Oil and Gold my stake in BABA is really small....laughably small :)",1427061206.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2zxwei/gold_advice_on_investment/cpnbjp7/
Commodities,Investing,2zxwei,Gold - advice on investment,cpnclim,"I'm not a huge fan of owning single stocks, let alone something like BABA. Too many issues with counterfeiting IMHO (which could at some point attract serious government attention) and way too volatile for my tastes, among all of the issues here: http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2kksbl/not_a_solid_investor_by_any_means_but_why_do/ . But that type of investing is not my style, your mileage may vary. 

The gold situation is the classic ""chase the hot trend"" mistake. At this point, I wouldn't sell it unless you absolutely need the money for the reasons platttypus mentioned. I really don't envy your position. Plus, you will have bought (very) high and will be selling (very) low, which is the exact opposite of what you want to be doing to come out ahead in the long run. You also mentioned your oil stocks have been beaten, I, as a long-term investor, would look at this as a buying opportunity, not a reason to be depressed. 

It sounds like you are all over the board with regards to your investing. You need to come up with a clear strategy that involves proper diversification. This way, when something like gold/oil/bonds/europe/asia/(insert shit here) etc... becomes ""hot"", you will presumably already have had it in your portfolio and can sit back and watch your portfolio grow while others are frantically scrambling to get in, making you even richer. I'm looking to add precious metals and mining to my brokerage account, but it will be around 3% of the total portfolio's value, and I plan to keep it that way for *at least* 20 years or so. People use this strategy to keep themselves disciplined, and only buy something when its value is low relative to the other investments in your portfolio. This helps avoid what you did.

Commodities,Investing,2ywwl4,is gold a good investment now?,cpdq4il,"Hey, 

I would not consider gold an investment because it, by itself, as no means of generating value. An investment is something that returns you money over time. Like buying a company that generates value. Gold does not generate value, but takes on the value we give it.

Trading gold can sometimes be seen as a hedge against inflation, although many disagree with this. It can also be seen as speculation. But I wouldn't see gold, the commodity, as an investment.

You may see it as semantics, but I think it's important. Investing in a gold company could be seen as an investment if you think the long-term prospects are good and the company will generate value. But if you are trading pure gold, or trading gold miners because they move with the price of gold, that is pure speculation and a trade.

Commodities,Investing,2e7lwu,What's the outlook for GLD?,cjx086q,"I break down my portfolio as 50% stock, 25% bonds, 15% REITs, and 5% each of cash and silver (I prefer silver over gold, but they are interchangeable). Precious metals just sit there. They don't really do anything. They should not increase in value, but they also shouldn't decrease in value. Their price is driven almost entirely by preference and desire rather than shortage.  
  
That being said, that's why I like them. As the world becomes richer (as it has for centuries and will continue as people come out of poverty), the demand for the unnecessary should rise. People may not eat more rice as they have more money, but they should buy more jewelry. So in the long term, I expect demand to be higher, though whether it beats inflation is unknown.  
  
What it is good for though, is that it just sits there. As stocks fluctuate and may even crash, it just sits there. That means that I have a way of getting more cash when I want it most and it isn't really convenient to convert it unless I really want it. Next recession, it will be there.  
  
And the best benefit, which you wouldn't get from GLD, is that it is shiny and physical and you can hold it and it represents a 5% portion of your wealth. You can see it growing in a way that a number in an account just doesn't illustrate. There are nice-looking silver coins, and for every one of those I have, I could buy 19 more if I wanted. Yes, I lose money on premiums and bid/ask, but they are kind of like a toy and I gain intangible value from them beyond the transaction cost.  
  
I'm not saying go all in, but holding a little bit is nice. ",1408665604.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2e7lwu/whats_the_outlook_for_gld/cjx086q/

Commodities,Investing,215yky,What do you think could happen to ETFs like SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) in an economic collapse?,cga55zx,"Depends on what you mean by economic collapse.

Owning GLD doesn't mean you actually own any gold. You have a stake in a fund whose prospectus states that its investment strategy is primarily focused on owning physical gold. Supposedly. Who's auditing GLD? Has anyone seen this physical gold? Where is it stored and who has access to it?

So what kind of economic collapse are we talking about? Does the SEC still exist and have any power? Is there a functioning legal system still in place? In a true collapse, the people with access the the bullion and the means to move it are the only true ""owners""...everybody else would be the proud owner of pieces of worthless paper.

Now, let's say the economy just takes another big hit, but the dollar is still the dollar and the U.S. is still a super power. In that case, GLD is probably somewhat profitable at least in the medium term. More profitable than a long-term investment in a beaten down economy would be? Doubtful.

Commodities,Investing,1u6doc,Large Cap versus Mid Cap ETFs,cef2uyx,"Sometimes I hate that I like to search for information then never save where I got the info from...  One of the things I read from a google search was that mid cap actually has outperformed both large and small cap in the long run.

As to your aside, not true.  Assuming that what we both said is correct, large cap is less volatile in both up and down, it would mean that in the long run mid cap might make more sense, but if you are closer to retirement or are someone who is terrified or losing a large % large cap is more stable.

I only compared VTI to VO, so that goes back less than 15 yeas.  Having said that, in 2008-09 when the market dropped VO dropped by noticeably more than VTI.  Slightly more interestingly though, the drop that VO experiences put both VTI and VO at similar YTD% (-32% vs -26.8% there had been more than 25% difference prior to this).

It sounds like my hypothesis may be worth following in the future, investing in VO instead of VTI.",1388621425.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1u6doc/large_cap_versus_mid_cap_etfs/cef2uyx/

Commodities,ETFs,1o2bujq,ETF Portfolio Advice,nimrtlm,"My advice is to invest a smaller amount each month in ETFs (for example maybe only $1,500 or $1,000) so that you have cash on hand to cover all your expenses. You shouldn't put money in the stock market that you might need in the next few years.  

In other words, I think it is better to make a budget, live within your means, and invest a smaller amount for the long-term future, than to invest a larger amount but risk ending up without enough cash to cover expenses (requiring you to cash out the investment after only 2 years, potentially at a loss). 

I like the ETFs you are investing in (they are good funds) it just doesn't sound like you can afford to invest $2k/month right now. So for now, invest the smaller amount that you can comfortably afford, and then $2k/month will be a good goal for the future (for example next time you get a raise at work).",1760031741.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1o2bujq/etf_portfolio_advice/nimrtlm/

Commodities,ETFs,1nhy5ed,"What do you think about this portfolio: VOO, FTEC, MAGS, GLD?",nehg9m6,"Thanks for the feedback — you’re absolutely right that defining goals and constraints is important when evaluating a portfolio.

For context, my current allocation looks like this:

* **FTEC 45%**
* **VOO 15%**
* **BRK.B 20%**
* **MOAT 10%**
* **SCHD 10%**

I invest regularly through DCA, and I also add proportionally whenever the S&P 500 drops by \~1%. I started this strategy in January and so far my portfolio is up about **7%**, but I noticed that if I had just held **VOO alone**, the return would be **13%+**.

So while my current mix spreads out risk, it also seems to be capping my upside. That’s why I’ve been thinking about adjusting toward a more aggressive ETF allocation. I know backtests can look attractive, but as long as I’m holding quality assets, I believe recovery over time is manageable.

Real estate and stocks have underlying value, people need somewhere to live and do business, and companies generate revenue through offering goods and services. BTC's tech is terrible even among cryptocurrencies. 

The fact that gamblers have kept it propped up for a long time doesn't mean that it magically has underlying value.

SCHD gets lots of love and hate, I personally don’t see the appeal unless maybe you are using it as a defensive hedge. I go a bit heavier into tech directly (FTEC and thinking about a small position in SMH as well) instead of something like SCHG which is too similar to VOO for my taste. I also used to hold VEA and AVDV but instead chose to consolidate my international position into AVDE - my thinking there is I’m not too high on the uncertainty and garbage that you’d find in dedicated emerging markets and broad all international. I like AVDE because it screens for quality/profitability and that’s all I need out of my international position.

So a summary of mine is basically 35% VOO, 25% AVDE, 15% AVUV 15% FTEC 10% BTC - similar thesis with a bit more simplicity.

SCHD is indeed meant as a defensive hedge. Although I am quite disappointed by it's recent performance. My guess would be that this is just temporary. Possibly until interest rates are cut and people look more for dividend yielding equities over their HYSAs.

I try to keep an even split between AVDV/DFIV as I found that this mimics the SP500 in terms of total annualized returns, and outperforms any other international ETFs I've found. This does come at a more expensive TER.

Good choice in terms of ftec for tech. I think all choices are heavily correlated and will probably do fine, though you make a good point to try to diversify from VOO.

One thing I’ve considered is pulling BTC (FBTC) out of my taxable (taking a slight cap gains hit) and starting to build a position in BRKB while it’s on the way down. That could fill the defensive hedge slot that you’re using SCHD for, but without any tax drag. It does a nice pseudoETF impression and has a lot of profitable quality businesses that do well in downturns.

Diversify more as others have said — add small cap and also make sure you’re hitting a nice amount of international.

Commodities,ETFs,1jj8qr5,Is my investing portfolio good,mjlfp8p,"I suggest not worrying about individual stocks. If you buy the entire market you guarantee yourself the average return of the market.

You’re also heavily weighted into large cap stocks, which might seem like a cool thing given how well they’ve performed over the last 15 years, but normally theres actually a skew towards smaller stocks outperforming. I would like to share a conversation I had with ChatGPT today.

Me: “Do you think the past 15 years of growth stock dominance has led to an overinflated belief in growth stocks from investors?“

ChatGPT: “Yes — the long run of growth stock outperformance created overconfidence in growth narratives, especially in a low-rate, tech-obsessed world. While many great companies earned their valuations, investor expectations drifted into optimism bias, assuming growth would always be rewarded, regardless of price or profit.

The next decade may look very different — and diversification across styles (growth, value, small cap, international) could become a much smarter strategy again.”",1742871433.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1jj8qr5/is_my_investing_portfolio_good/mjlfp8p/

Commodities,ETFs,1j6mhts,Did I Improve Ray Dalio’s All-Weather Portfolio? A Look at the Numbers,mgpynth,"Early-retired fan of Dalio here and our portfolio is a variation on his theme. He's big on hard assets right now and likes a 10-15% allocation of gold. I kind of hate on gold myself but held my nose and bought some a few years back. Of course, I'm happy with the outcome. Now it's grown into the position size that Dalio likes and I plan to keep it this way for a while.

My take on Dalio's advice is that he seems to want to divide risk evenly between asset classes. And that's what I strove to do. The circled part of the graph? About 18 months ago I put 1/3 of the risk in each of my 3 asset classes. Hard assets outperformed in the meantime and I'm sitting on the risk profile that you seen. I don't plan on trimming hard assets just yet though.

This pie in recent years only captures half the returns when the markets rip upwards. But we're fortunate we only need the pie to keep up with inflation for our retirement to be successful.

How's it doing recently?

Commodities,ETFs,1ivmyke,Diversified portfolio - what are your thoughts?,me6yd86,"Not well diversified.  Highly concentrated in USA large-cap stocks (S&P 500 + NASDAQ 100).

Large-cap US stocks (S&P 500) can be a great investment, but they're not a complete retirement portfolio.  Other assets should be included, such as smaller-cap US stocks, international stocks, & bonds.

QQQM (NASDAQ 100) is a great marketing gimmick for NASDAQ & uncompensated risk for investors.  No thanks! Picking stocks based on which exchange they're traded on reduces diversification but doesn't increase expected returns.  PepsiCo & Coca-Cola - one is in QQQM & 1 is not, because 1 trades on NASDAQ & the other doesn't.

 Vanguard recommends that 20-40% of stocks be internationals.  Your portfolio is below that range, so you can't expect to get much benefit from that diversification.

www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started has some great free resources to learn about investing. After a few hours reading the articles, and, especially, watching the Bogleheads Philosophy videos, most beginners can learn how to get better results than most professionals. Bogleheads is named after John Bogle, founder of Vanguard.  

I retired at 57 years old. Investing doesn't have to be complicated or costly to be successful; simple & inexpensive is most effective.

I invest 100% in total-market, index-based, low-cost mutual funds. Specifically, I use mostly Vanguard's 
Total Stock Market, 
Total Bond Market, 
Total International Stock Market, & 
Total International Bond Market funds. 
I've been investing this way for 40+ years. It's effective, simple, & inexpensive.

My asset allocation (ratios of the funds mentioned) is based on my need, ability, & willingness to take risks. Market conditions are not a factor. Vanguard's investor questionnaire (personal.vanguard.com/us/FundsInvQuestionnaire) helps me determine my asset allocation.

The funds I use comprise Vanguards target date funds and LifeStrategy funds; these are excellent choices for many investors. Using the component funds allows some flexibility that can have tax benefits, but also creates the need for me to rebalance them periodically. Expense ratios are slightly higher than for the components but are well worth it for many investors.

Other companies have funds similar to the ones I own that would work well. I prefer Vanguard because they've been the leader in this type of investing for decades & because Vanguard's customers are also Vanguard's owners.

SCV hasn't outperformed for the last 15 years.  There's no guarantee that it will again in a time period that will benefit any particular investor.

Commodities,ETFs,1ilpx5f,Looking for feedback on my long-term ETF strategy,mbxpaas,"A few notes, I would take another look at gold.  It’s meant as a hedge against inflation and it has no real return over a long enough period, that’s kind of its whole point.  It’s a questionable asset for anyone and it’s very limited use case if for someone decades your senior.  Equities are your inflation hedge.  If you want a “safe” asset, consider us treasuries.

Growth and dividend strategies are also probably not suitable for long term holdings.  Value has outperformed growth in the long run historically and VTI is already basically a large cap blend fund sort of tilting toward growth.  Dividends are questionable at best for long term accumulation and often end up being another pseudo-value asset.  Retirees often like dividends as a comfort object but they usually do not outperform normal equities in total return.

If you want a small cap value(SCV) tilt, its current champions more or less say you gotta commit to it indefinitely to capture any factor premium.  Many folks believe the factor premium is already priced in or even decreasing with VC.  If you want to keep it, you should probably ditch the other small cap fund (as small cap growth isn’t appealing to anyone).

10% international is unlikely to be large enough to matter.  Most advice is 20-40% or don’t bother.

Honestly, I think something like this would serve you better:

50% VTI

15% US SCV AVUV

20% International VXUS

15% Intermediate US Treasuries (such as VGIT)

Commodities,ETFs,1ilpx5f,Looking for feedback on my long-term ETF strategy,mbz03rc,"I think it's over complicated for what it is trying to do.

VTI is US total market. XMMO and AVUV might make sense if you want to weight towards small cap and mid cap, though they are contained in VTI. You could swap out the VTI with a lower proportion of VOO or SCHG and a bit more XMMO/AVUV, or you could just do VTI.

SCHG is held within VTI too - they are 50% identical.  It's a good fund, but you're taking VTI and then adding more large cap growth, more mid cap, and more small cap value to it. This may sound weird, but it's actually decreasing your diversification to do this, not increasing it.

GLD - I wouldn't bother, but if you want something that's not equities, bonds should be considered.

SCHD - Why?  It's not a bad fund, but you're investing in the long term here and the dividends don't actually help you at all.  Again, it is decreasing your diversification rather than increasing it.

VXUS - I'd consider going to 20%.  I know that the US market has outperformed international substantially in recent years, but this isn't guaranteed to be the case.

DBA - I don't understand why you'd consider adding a sector specific fund to the mix here. Are you just looking at it because returns in the last 5 years have been better than VXUS?

I have two relatively simple ideas here, one is much more simple, and the other is a bit closer to what you're doing but reduces the complexity a bit.  You can fudge the numbers, of course, and if you want a more focused international fund, you could do something that isn't VXUS.

1. 80% VTI, 20% VXUS / or 70% VTI, 10% AVUV, 20% VXUS if you want the small value tilt
2. 45% SCHG + 20% XMMO + 15% AVUV + 20% VXUS - This gives you large growth, mid, and small value plus international.
3. If you want less volatility, you could add 10-20% bonds, which will likely eat in to your long term returns a bit

Again, the percentages here are fudged and approximate, but in each of these, I can justify every position.

The most important thing is that you consistently invest and not worry too much about fluctuations.  Make a plan and stick with it.  You'll want to rebalance periodically too - personally I like the idea of rebalancing by adjusting purchases in a taxable account so as to not incur capital gains.",1739165532.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1ilpx5f/looking_for_feedback_on_my_longterm_etf_strategy/mbz03rc/

Why the additional tilting into Healthcare? Do you have some insider information that healthcare will become the next BIG sector like TECH? If not, then don’t randomly tilt into Health. Also, good healthcare stocks in VHT are already in VOO so you are double-dipping into those stocks here too.

AVUV is far superior than VTWO because Small Cap Value is what outperforms not the whole small cap asset class itself. So invest into that directly using AVUV.

Commodities,ETFs,1hzaseu,Question about taxes on the ETF GLD,m6sjfdi,"Instead of using the 0%, 15% and 20% long-term cap-gain tiers, gains on a gold etf are, in effect, taxed like ordinary income up to a max of 28%. So, if you were single in 2024 and made less than $95k in income then you're in the 12% bracket and that's the tax you'd pay on your gold gains. 

Another tax wrinkle rabbit hole to dive into:   
  
With the Trump tax cuts precious metal ETFs that are grantor trusts (GLD,IAU,SGOL,etc.) have a new tax treatment w/regard to the ETF's expenses. The good news is you get to add the fund's expenses back into your cost basis. The bad news is that tiny amounts of our gold are sold throughout the year to pay those expenses. Those teensy-tiny sales are taxable events and we shareholders are now responsible for reporting them when the total taxable gain is more than the so-called ""de minimis"" amount (which the ETF themselves seems to determine). For this reason, a useful tip might be to choose a gold fund with low fees in order to increase the chances that the fees will be small enough to fall into the ""de minimis"" camp. 

In other words, the 1099 we get from the broker might indicate that, say, $300 are the proceeds our gold fund raised in order to pay a year's worth of expenses. That $300 can be added to our cost basis, but we must also properly figure out the gain/loss on that $300 and pay the taxes, as necessary. But the calc to do this properly is daunting, so a lot of people will simply throw in the towel, say their cost basis is zero, and pay tax on the full $300.  But to reiterate, if the gain is flagged as ""de minimis"" on the 1099 then I personally have been taking that to mean that I don't have to bother with the detailed reporting. In recent years with my SGOL holdings I have always gotten a ""de minimis"" indication on my 1099.

Commodities,ETFs,1hp6e8b,26yo In Canada Portfolio- how to consolidate ,m4gh2t5,"If your risk appetite is high, then a 100% equities portfolio will be best-suited for your needs.

Go for an asset allocation ETF like XEQT or VEQT for a better risk-adjusted returns using just a single ETF. XEQT or VEQT has every relevant stock across the globe including Emerging Markets which matter. Both of these can be held into TFSA & RRSP as well as Non-Reg if required. If you want to be an actual passive investor and ride the gains from the Market, then both of these ETFs will fulfill that criteria. Additionally, they are canadian-domiciled ETFs which means no need to get bothered by FX conversion fees when buying US domiciled etfs or stocks.

Please don’t chase past performance by investing in Thematic ETFs like QQQM, VUG, VONG, SMH, VGT, FTEC, SCHG, etc. or Canadian Equivalents like XIT.TO, TEC.TO, QQC.TO, ZQQ.TO etc. as they introduce uncompensated risk into your portfolio which may often provide short-term growth but stagnate over long run as compared to broad market ETFs. And their MER is mostly high comparative to an Index Fund ETF which increases your average weighted portfolio MER as a result.

Just buying either one of these ETFs would make your life easier by simply DCA’ing or Lump Sum investing into it whenever you have cash available. Wealthsimple offers fractional shares but both of them are on lower end of share price, so it’d be convenient to purchase a full share even if you have accounts in other brokerages and they don’t offer fractional shares.

Also, having a 20-30% home bias i.e., for Canada will make your portfolio robust in terms of risk-adjusted returns.",1735524729.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1hp6e8b/26yo_in_canada_portfolio_how_to_consolidate/m4gh2t5/

Commodities,ETFs,1hketin,Looking for different perspectives on my ETF portfolio,m3e3063,"No one knows what's going to happen in the short term.  Don't try to guess what's going to do well in 2025.  Understand what's almost certain to do well over the next few decades.

www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started has some great free resources to learn about investing. After a few hours reading the articles, and, especially, watching the Bogleheads Philosophy videos, most beginners can learn how to get better results than most professionals. Bogleheads is named after John Bogle, founder of Vanguard.

I retired at 57 years old. Investing doesn't have to be complicated or costly to be successful; simple & inexpensive is most effective.

I invest 100% in total-market, index-based, low-cost mutual funds. Specifically, I use mostly Vanguard's 
Total Stock Market, 
Total Bond Market, 
Total International Stock Market, & 
Total International Bond Market funds. 
I've been investing this way for 35+ years. It's effective, simple, & inexpensive.

My asset allocation (ratios of the funds mentioned) is based on my need, ability, & willingness to take risks. Market conditions are not a factor. Vanguard's investor questionnaire (personal.vanguard.com/us/FundsInvQuestionnaire) helps me determine my asset allocation.

Buying individual stocks or sector funds creates unnecessary & uncompensated risk; I avoid doing so. Index funds are boring, but better for making money. If I wanted to talk about my interesting investments at parties or wanted a new hobby, I might invest 5-10% of my portfolio in individual stocks. As it is, I own pretty much every publicly-traded company in the world; that's interesting enough for me.

All of the individual stocks & sector funds are being followed by thousands or millions of other investors. Current prices reflect their collective knowledge of future expectations for each one. I'm a member of the Triple Nine Society, but I'm not smarter than all of them. If I found a stock or sector that looked like a bargain, the most likely explanation would be that the others know something I don't.

I prefer mutual funds, but ETFs could also work well. The differences are usually trivial for a long-term investor, especially if they're the Vanguard funds I mentioned above. Actually, the Vanguard funds I mentioned above have both traditional mutual fund shares & ETF shares; they both represent a piece of the same fund.

The funds I use comprise Vanguards target date funds and LifeStrategy funds; these are excellent choices for many investors. Using the component funds allows some flexibility that can have tax benefits, but also creates the need for me to rebalance them periodically. Expense ratios are slightly higher than for the components but are well worth it for many investors.

Other companies have funds similar to the ones I own that would work well. I prefer Vanguard because they've been the leader in this type of investing for decades & because Vanguard's customers are also Vanguard's owners.

I hope that helps! I'd be happy to help w/ further questions. Best wishes!",1734927355.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1hketin/looking_for_different_perspectives_on_my_etf/m3e3063/

But here's maybe a smarter move that most folks miss with HSAs - consider swapping that SLV position for TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) instead; they can help protect against medical inflation specifically, which tends to run higher than general inflation and is more relevant for an HSA's purpose.

The 10% IAU is solid for hedging, but I'd actually suggest bumping VTI to 85-90% and just keeping 10-15% in TIPS - remember, your HSA has this amazing triple tax advantage (no tax going in, growing, or coming out for medical expenses), so you might as well maximize the growth potential while still keeping that inflation protection.

My best advice is to invest it all now, and for at least the next 10 years into SPLG and make sure you check the “DRIP” Box. One day the dividends will auto-reinvest. 

The reason for SPLG is simple: you have exposure to 500 of the largest companies in the USA, many of which are the largest worldwide. They are or will be cashflow machines for years to come. 

You’ll never get rich in any given year investing in it, you’ll never go broke either because of the sheer dollars involved in those companies. 

The way become wealthier is over time. Invest every time you get paid, forever. At least think of it that way. As you put money in and buy shares and the dividends reinvest, plus the share value grows your account grows. 

This discipline and the power of the market will eventually make your family quite comfortable.

With you're situation, in the Roth, just focus on starting and growing a single total US market (ITOT, SCHB, SPTM, or VTI), or a SP500 (BKLC, IVV, SPLG, or VOO) fund before spreading your limited dollars across other funds, which will slow down your growth by spreading you thin. 

$10k would be a solid initial amount to work towards in that single fund. Just pick one from the above and hammer it from now on. You can add other markets etfs (IXUS, VXUS, SPDW, or SCHF) after you've reached that $10k if you so choose.

Be wary of who you're using for a custodian. I've used Vanguard, Schwab, and some others. Fidelity offers the best combination of features with ease of use, and lets you buy fractions of etfs.

Is this savings for retirement, or are you trying to buy a house before 30?  Low risk, in general shouldn’t be a concern, since you can hold decades through a downturn and recovery and still retire well.

Index fund investing, with something like VOO is low risk in that the S&P 500 will never go to 0.  So it’s impossible to lose everything, VOO could drop by 50% for 4 years, slowly recovering, but as long as you wait, you’re investment is safe, and will be doubled 10 years later.

On the other hand something like BTC could have a bug discovered that makes it worthless next week.  As long as you stick with the popular index funds, VOO, VTI, VXUS, heck VGT, your risk level is “low”.  But to really be low risk, a mix of bonds would be needed.",1715096494.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1cmb9uf/what_to_diversify_100_etf_portfolio_with/l2zst5u/

Commodities,ETFs,133sxgx,Adding a new etf.,jiedh35,"If you want to invest in something besides Stocks, I'd maybe avoid commodity ETFs. I went through a phase myself of commodity etfs thinking ""these will really help diversify my portfolio"". The problem is that they are non-productive funds, meaning you're not going to receive a dividend from it and it costs more to manage because it's being backed by a physical asset. If you want something besides stocks, I'd look at a short term bond ETF like SHV. It has a market beta of 0.02 (VOO is 1.00) so your money will be relatively safe there. Plus, bond ETFs make up for their lack of growth by paying dividends monthly. This doesn't have to be a big allocation, maybe 10% or so depending on your age.

VDC is always solid because it's the exact definition of a recession proof ETF, considering it's products people will buy regardless of economic conditions. You may have some overlap with SCHD and/or VOO.

Overall, if you're investing for the long term, you don't particularly need to worry about recessions. If we look back to 1929, 1987, and 2008, there's been rules and regulations in place to help prevent events like that from happening. Not saying a market decline of that magnitude isn't possible in the future, but as long as you don't sell and keep putting money into diversifed ETFs, you'll weather whatever storm the economy throws at you.",1682919090.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/133sxgx/adding_a_new_etf/jiedh35/

Commodities,ETFs,us9ffl,Long term Roth to b used as college fund in 17 yrs.,i928r9q,"I won't comment much on the individual company stocks, other than to note that they're well represented in QQQ anyway. Frankly I'd advise dropping QQQ before AAPL in the current environment.

Is there a reason you've chosen high dividend ETFs? VTI is the default recommendation around here for a reason.

Regarding DGRO and VYM (I assume that's what you meant), you're right, there's a lot of overlap there. If you want to hit high dividend stocks from both sides, DGRO and SPYD would form a pretty reasonable barbell.

DBC is interesting. Commodities have been strong, but right now they're fighting against rising interest rates, China lockdown and recession fears. Not being a cash yielding asset, in the long run you're likely to lose out to fees and negative carry.

Another way to play commodities is with a managed futures fund like CTA or KMLM. I have absolutely no idea what your best option is, or if you should even bother with commodities at all. You probably shouldn't, it's a difficult game even for the pros.

I would mention bonds, but as you're planning to maximise the account every year, they're really not necessary.

At this stage, the services of a certified financial planner , preferably one who is also a Cfa, are not unwarranted despite the fee. Just don’t pay a “financial advisor” a single dollar unless he has cfp, and Cfa, preferably both but at least cfp. 

Planning at this stage is incredibly complex. Using mortality tables to calculate probabilistic present value of expected future needed expenses until death to determine what is referred to as your core capital and whether you meet that need currently. How much of it will be met by your pension? Is your pension Dc or DB? These things all matter. 

That figure will be used to determine the optimal level of risk for you at this stage. The amounts matter, not just what etfs you invest in. The amount you have invested relative to expected retirement needs and whatever you’re pension benefits is, will determine your optimal risk allocation. This stuff is worth a small fee but not to a “financial advisor”. 

I understand however that at a certain size it is not worth it to pay someone.

To be honest, it would take a fair amount of calculation and speculation to begin to form an opinion one way or the other, because there’s going to be a lot of overlap at varying weights across baskets.

Commodities,ETFs,mi4s1m,Opinions,gt2qc55,"If you prefer VOO to VTI, that's fine and reasonable. The typical foundation to your portfolio will be something like VTI + VXUS. 

In my opinion, there are lots of reasonable deviations from the standard core holdings. But you should be able to offer yourself good reasons for your deviation. Otherwise, stick to the core holdings, which you know will be good investments in the long term. 

I would avoid the fad ETFs, the ones hyped a bunch, the ones with massively inflated underlying holdings, etc. That stuff is either just too spicy, or too speculative, to make sense at the moment. Some ETFs seem like retail investor traps. Like they're designed to attract lots of younger or naive investors, since the fund makes their money by taking a percentage of their assets under management. You can donate to them or you can invest for yourself. 

One last bit of advice. You can pick the right company or sector and still lose. Lots of people are doing the easy part of picking sectors like clean energy or EVs correctly. That's the easy part, but figuring out how best to profit from these sectors is less obvious. In emerging industries, there'll be many more losers than winners. In my opinion, there are some popular ETFs with what will turn out to be mostly losers.

It's an interesting hedge in the long term; model portfolios that try to reduce volatility by having different uncorrelated assets seem to make good use of it.

Commodities,Bogleheads,1n0416u,Starting investing at 26.,nat5ja8,"> I already have a Roth IRA courtesy of my work that I try to max out every year. I get the full match from my job as well.

Probably not a Roth IRA through work.

Probably a different kind of account from work. Do you mean you have a workplace retirement account like a 401k (maybe you're making Roth 401k contributions) that you're getting a match on, and also you have a Roth IRA?

How is this (or these) accounts invested?

> VT, VOO, and VOX.

The important part about **the** [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) is not the count of *three* funds, it's the three asset classes: Total US, Total International, and Bonds.

VT already fully covers the first two asset classes.

VOO (S&P500) is already covered by VT; about 50% of VT *is* VOO.

International and US have [cycles of outperformance](https://www.mymoneyblog.com/us-vs-international-stocks-cycles-outperformance.html) compared to each other, so you don't have to tilt extra towards US (or large cap).

No need to tilt towards VOX (communications sector) or [any sector](https://novelinvestor.com/sector-performance/), because sectors outperform in unpredictable ways and the market already has priced in all the available information about future expected performance. Tilting in that way tends to just introduce [uncompensated risk](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/), which means that you're taking on more risk than investing in a total market index fund, but you can't expect to receive better returns than the market average. Again: you'll own all these companies at market weight when you own the total market.

> I am planning to buy VT and VTI 

VT *or* VTI + VXUS.

> 3 years

For short time frames a cash equivalent like HYSA, CD, Money Market Fund, T-Bills, or [treasury floating rate note ETF](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/11prp0b/hysa_mmf_cds_tbills_searching_for_the_best_return/) would be more appropriate. The market can be down, or flat, for a couple years.

Commodities,Bogleheads,1n0416u,Starting investing at 26.,nau3iet,"Thanks for the reply! I understand a Roth IRA to be an account that lets you deposit cash after your paycheck is taxed. So that when you withdraw it in retirement you draw it tax free

As opposed to a 401k where the main difference is taxes later as opposed to now and money being taken before the paycheck is taxed. 

In my work case, I deposit cash each paycheck(automatically) and my work matches that and this happens post paycheck being taxed. Does that not constitute a ROTH IRA? Is 401k exclusively from work and Roth IRA is something I would make myself at a bank that provides it?

Commodities,Bogleheads,1mmpm98,"Jared Dillian ""Awesome Portfolio""",n7zbvkx,"VTI is great. Total US market, the first asset class of the [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio)
of total US + total International + Bonds.

BND is US aggregate bond market fund, generally recommended as the default choice of fund for the third asset class.

Gold may keep up with inflation over a long period of time, but isn't part of the boglehead portfolio.

There's a huge spectrum between investing in a property you own and manage and investing in a REIT. Many people have had success with real estate, but that doesn't mean everyone has to do it -- it can become a second job. REITs are contained in VTI already, and some people like to tilt towards REITs a little.

Cash (money market funds) is not a great choice for a long term portfolio, it will generally lose to a bond market fund (and inflation) over time.

The equal weighting of those five components is a little bonkers to me.

The portfolio is missing International. International and US have [cycles of outperformance](https://www.mymoneyblog.com/us-vs-international-stocks-cycles-outperformance.html) compared to each other, so holding international is wise. The global market weight is about 60% US, 40% International.

Yes, by far.

Risk parity portfolios are much more conservative and prioritize non-correlating assets over growth. 

A good risk parity portfolio allows withdrawing 5-8% per year, higher than the more common 3-5% equities/bonds portfolio (e.g., from the Trinity Study). The downside is that unlike the more typical equities/bonds portfolio, the portfolio won't continue to appreciate during your drawdown. 80%+ (probably 90%+ if you're smart about it) chance, the equities/bonds portfolio will end up worth more than when you started. 

Risk Parity is good for a higher SWR when you want to retire early (earlier), or just withdrawal more, and don't care to leave as much to heirs.

Commodities,Bogleheads,1l9lib9,Taxable account advice for a new boglehead,mxesrnz,">Why is JL Collins so anti-international equities?

Just based on my reading of his blog I think it's an artifact of strong home-country bias combined with recency bias given that the US experienced a long period of (unsustainable) secular performance from 2009-2024. 

To be fair, he has written about the virtues of international diversification and at least mentioned VTWAX as perhaps being more suitable for long-term investing, particularly for younger generations, in his blog entry about [Investing for Seven Generations](https://jlcollinsnh.com/2019/03/03/stocks-part-xxxv-investing-for-seven-generations/). He stopped short of endorsing VTWAX, sadly, but it does seem that he is aware of the validity of criticism here and has softened his tone a bit, even if some of his more strident acolytes remain steadfastly opposed to such diversification. None of the supposed benefits of investing 100% in the US market withstand scrutiny and really appear to be nothing more than home-country and recency bias. This is why I often suggest that Collins adherents read Malkiel's *A Random Walk Down Wall Street* because Malkiel explains and exposes the folly of such bias.",1749747471.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1l9lib9/taxable_account_advice_for_a_new_boglehead/mxesrnz/

Commodities,Bogleheads,1l7qgir,Getting into stocks as a 16 y/o,mx0ei7z,"It's great that you have some extra money to invest and are getting started on your investing journey.

The general advice for long term investing in stocks in Bogleheads would be VT, Vanguard's Global Market Etf with the philosophy that since the majority of people can't predict or time the market, just ""own"" the whole market because on average it goes up over the long term. That's with a lot of variability like a yo-yo being walked up a long mountain path. So, it's for money that you won't need for 20 years or more. 

VT is an exchange traded fund that holds about 9883 stocks of countries around the world to capture the average global market performance. Over the long term global markets historically beat inflation and that difference compounded builds wealth.

For money you might need in five years, equities (stocks) like VT invests in are too volatile. You could be lucky, but you could also see the value drop by over 40% in a bad market. You could offset the risk with bonds and something like 30% VT and 70% BND (a US bond etf). Or simply use something like  CD's if you wanted to be more conservative.

Gold is not necessarily the best investment. I've invested in gold etfs in the past and over the long term the returns are less than global equities. Here's a great video on the subject: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulgqlQWlPbo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulgqlQWlPbo) 

Two of the easier books I've found on investing are Elements of Investing by Malkiel and Ellis and Millionaire Teacher by Andrew Hallam. Either of them would be a great start in helping you understand the basics. Elements Of Investing is a little more basic. Millionaire Teacher gets a bit more detailed. But both are relatively engaging reads.

Remember that the important part about **the** [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) is not the count of three funds, it's the three asset classes: Total US, Total International, and Bonds.

So, what do you have here?

QQQ is ""the 100 largest (non-financial) companies that happen to trade on the nasdaq exchange"". There's no fundamental reason for that selection criteria to outperform in the future, it only looks attractive because of the last decade of performance. It accidentally happens to tilt towards tech, so it has recent outperformance because of US large cap, and growth, and tech, but it's honestly a nonsense criteria for an index and no one needs it.

XLV is a health sector fund. The problem with tilting towards health care, or tech, or [any sector](https://novelinvestor.com/sector-performance/), is that sectors outperform in unpredictable ways and the market already has priced in all the available information about future expected performance. Tilting in that way tends to just introduce [uncompensated risk](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/), which means that you're taking on more risk than investing in a total market index fund, but you can't expect to receive better returns than the market average.

I'm estimating international stocks have a 0.5 to 0.7 positive correlation with US stocks with about the same expected returns minus the tax drag and we've seen historically where rebalancing may have been useful. There are other things such as trend following (managed futures) that perform well in a back test but the data only goes back 20 years or so.

I just stick to 3 main principles when it comes to asset allocation decisions:

* Positive expected real return
* Non-correlation to other asset classes I'm using

>safest way to invest a lumpsum is in index funds

All at once in a lump sum is better than spreading it out about 2/3 of the time. If you do want to spread it out, make a schedule and stick to it regardless of market movements, consider doing it all within three months.

>I'm unsure of investing a huge amount for potential risks of a correction

>$FXAIX, $VOO, $GLD, $VTI, $MORN, $BND, $AVUX, $VXUS. 

I think you need to look a little more closely at what these tickers are.

FXAIX and VOO are the same thing, the s&p 500, which is about 85% of the US market.

VTI is the total US market. There's no value in holding s&p 500 when you already own the total US market.

Gold may keep up with inflation over long periods of time, but it does not have to be part of your portfolio. 

Investing in a single company stock like morningstar exposes you to [uncompensated risk](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/), which means that you're taking on more risk than investing in a total market index fund, but you can't expect to receive better returns than the market average.

AVUX seems to be a typo, I'm guessing it's supposed to be some small cap value fund. While there is some literature that suggests small cap value has higher risk adjusted returns than the market average, it is not necessary to hold a small cap value tilt, if you do you should be prepared to hold it for decades because that's how long it might take the small cab value premium to show up, if it exists at all.

VTI, VXUS, and BND are a great way to get the [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio)
of total US + total International + Bonds.

You can look at a target date fund [glide path](https://institutional.vanguard.com/investment/strategies/tdf-glide-path.html) to get a reasonable starting point for an asset allocation that makes sense for your age.

You are already dollar-cost-averaging into an aggressive fund. On this score I would advise that it be a very low-cost index fund rather than a high-cost managed fund.

As for investing a lump sum: 

First make sure you retain an emergency fund of 4 to 6 months of income, perhaps around $40k (?). If you live in a high-tax state it might make sense to look at T-Bills. Buying at auction and holding to maturity will usually beat out a high-yield savings account, plus that income is sheltered from state income tax. 

Second, for money in excess of your emergency fund, others have said that time in market beats timing the market, and that is true. It is especially true for someone your age, with a very long investment horizon. Buying the dips feels good when it works, but the evidence suggests it is not a high-return strategy relative to being in the market. I confess I keep aside some small amount of money in T-Bills that I use to buy  big dips when they occur, and they will occur, because it makes me happy, which is worth something.

That is single country risk, which is an *uncompensated* risk: one that doesn't bring higher expected long term returns. Uncompensated risk should be avoided whenever possible.

Compensated vs uncompensated risk:

I do not see sufficient action in DC to make major changes around these anticompetitive forces in the near future, so I think it could easily be 10 years before this gets turned around and another 10 years before SCV starts to out-perform again. I think the \~30-40 years of SCV out-performance since 1970 is not necessarily an investing law, but possibly just another historical cycle - much like US and international swap back and forth, I don't see a clear reason why SCV and LC or LCG couldn't swap as well.

I think the other commenter who suggested a barbell SCV and LCG has a good point, and I would note that is actually more similar to your present-day composition with \~30% SCV and \~50% LCG.

However, if the goal is to meet, and maybe only slightly exceed, the market - why not just buy the market, and add a small tilt? It sounds like you are a sufficiently cognizant investor to not sell when things go down, so short-term volatility shouldn't matter much to you. Barbelling SCV and LCG would provide good balance between the two, but at that point you're basically at total US market anyways. Then if you add some of the missing international back in, you're back at VT + VGLT and maybe a slight SCV tilt. That's why  I think this approach is unnecessarily complicated (in terms of trying to match the market without buying the market) and risky (in terms of the narrow niche of SCV potentially under-performing for decades and neglecting major international markets). 

As you noted, historical results are not indicative of future results.

Okay, but you should consider your total portfolio as the sum of all your investments in all your accounts. 

>ROTH IRA: (20 funds)

A mess, but you can easily simplify this, because there's no tax consequence to exchanging funds in a Roth IRA. 

How about a 
[three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio)
of total US + total International + Bonds?

VT covers US + international.

You could reasonably consider making your Roth IRA 100% VT, or 90% VT + 10% BND.

>Brokerage account: (15 funds)

Luckily your largest position here is VTI (Total US market), which is an excellent fund - keep that. For each of the other funds, you may want to consider the tax consequences of selling them: if you've held the shares for longer than a year, they'll be subject to the more favorable capital gains tax rates, you'll only owe taxes on the gains, and if there are some funds that have losses, they will offset the gain. If there are not substantial taxes to be paid, you might seriously consider selling them all and simplifying down to VTI + VXUS + BND in taxable as well.

It's a little bit more tax advantageous to hold your bonds in a pre-tax/traditional account like your rollover IRA, because bond funds Will send you monthly distributions tax at your ordinary income tax rate so they're not the perfect fit for a taxable account, but they're not poison either.",1717778922.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1daf3g1/31yo_new_boglehead_portfolio_review_us_based/l7jw6zf/

There is value in comparing the models and glidepaths across vendors for the same year before picking a vendor because reasonable people can disagree on the optimum glidepath but I wouldn't invest in all of them, just review and select them.",1699543561.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/17qecd8/exited_schwab_robo_advisor_now_what/k8ifb8l/

Commodities,Bogleheads,13i9n3w,Opinion of holding Physical Precious Metal ETFs in IRA account?,jkbqrqu,"Here is a nice discussion about gold:

https://portfoliocharts.com/2020/08/21/metal-money-and-the-measurable-value-of-gold/

I hold gold because I’m close to retirement.  The data suggests that gold increases SWR even though it also lowers performance.  During withdrawal I’m more or less happy to make this trade.

To quote Tyler as to why I believe that gold has a place in a BH strategy:

“Pay close attention to the curve with long term bonds, though, as it demonstrates an interesting phenomenon where anything above or below 40% stocks is both higher risk AND lower return than the right combination of the two assets. **Both stocks and long term bonds are relatively undesirable in isolation, but the combination of the two moves the portfolio point dramatically in the right direction.**

It’s that lesson that really unlocks the power of understanding modern portfolio theory. **Combinations of volatile complementary assets can have much more desirable performance than any one asset by itself.**”

https://portfoliocharts.com/2021/12/16/three-secret-ingredients-of-the-most-efficient-portfolios/

Finally:

“So two things can be true at the same time:

* An asset is a critical component in many of the most desirable portfolios.

* The same asset is disastrously undesirable when studied only in isolation.”

So I hold around 5-10% of our portfolio as gold.  Just like I hold about 5-10% of our portfolio as SCV.  The range varies depending on whether you look at my personal retirement portfolio in isolation or as part of our joint retirement assets including pensions, etc.

I like Tyler’s analysis because it doesn’t look at it in isolation and is backed by data.

Analysis like Ben Felix’s doesn’t answer why a smattering of gold apparently increases SWR/SAFEMAX.  In fact it ignores that it happens at all.

BigERN has also looked at it, claiming to have been skeptical but more or less ending where Tyler ended up.  Gold is a terrible asset by itself but has, at least for the limited data we have, provided benefits.

https://earlyretirementnow.com/2020/01/08/gold-hedge-against-sequence-risk-swr-series-part-34/comment-page-1/amp/

We take for granted that something like 60/40 BH 2 fund is a reasonable allocation based on essentially the same data (trinity and bengen) that also shows (if you trust ERN’s math) that a 15% gold allocation, during that same historical period, reduced failure rate and slightly improved SWR when used in the withdrawal phase.

If you want to discount the empirical support for gold you pretty much also need to discount the empirical underpinnings of the BH 2 or 3 fund portfolios...of course for some folks “backtesting” itself is evil juju that should be ignored.

TL;DR:  simply saying “gold bad” ignores that it beats BH 2 fund over the same historical period that Trinity, et al is based on.",1684209966.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/13i9n3w/opinion_of_holding_physical_precious_metal_etfs/jkbqrqu/

I agree. I did think about this when I formed this portfolio but that was purely because of the fact that I knew I was going to be passive, at that time, I thought being conservative would be the safe thing to do. 

Answering your questions -

1. I had house buying on the horizon back then but nothing worked out and given the current interest rates, I'm going to likely continue renting for another 2-3 years if not more. Other than that, nothing else for short term.

2. I'd say moderate risks for me and my understanding is limited to general financial things and I don't have deep understanding of market dynamics.

My basic reasoning on physical is the old school saying “you don’t have it, you don’t own it.”  Gold/Silver best attribute is it is the only asset without counter party risk.  So why buy an ETF and add counter party risk?  Lots of ETFs just track the price of the metal using derivatives, futures or something else.  Some you can’t take delivery if you want to.  Read a prospectus on GLD and tell me if you can understand what they are doing, I can’t.  But I do know they can force settle you in cash if they want to.    

My opinion would be if you don’t want to deal with storage of physical.  Go with the miners.  You get more metal exposure bang for your buck with them anyway.

The DBC at 1% is precisely why I don't use the M1 expert pies.

I put one of the M1 target pies into a taxable account, and I got a surprise K-1.  I'd never even heard of them before.  K-1's are super annoying on tax day: they're not like 1099's.  They arrive late and are a pain to enter into your forms as they're a series of instructions like:  ""Add $X to line 18, Subtract $Y from schedule M line 7"" or things like that.

The presence of DBC in my taxable added an hour or two to my taxes two years running (I sold it the second year when I discovered how annoying K-1s are), and at the amounts I owned of the security (like <$500), the $X and $Y amounts I was adding and removing were in the single digits.  If it were super profitable at a higher amount, sure, I'd consider dealing with it, but I value my time at greater than that.

I'm surprised they don't replace DBC with PDBC, at least for future investments.  maybe someday u/M1-Alex or someone else there will listen...

>Tax ReportingDue to financial regulations, most commodity funds, including DBC, are structured as commodity pools, which means investors must file a K-1 form come tax season. These forms are something of a hassle, and a deal-breaker for many investors.PDBC avoids these issues by investing in commodities through a subsidiary. As per financial regulations, doing so allows the fund to be structured as an open-ended fund, which does not require filing a K-1 form. PDBC's simpler tax reporting requirements are a benefit for the fund and its shareholders, especially so for investors wishing to avoid the hassle of filing K-1 forms.

Edit to add:  PDBC does have far greater capital distributions, but that seems like it would be  beneficial from an M1 perspective, as it would give more cashflow for the auto-invest-based rebalancing, and it would be reported on a 1099.",1649952499.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/u3ccbt/rate_m1s_aggressive_2060_tdf/i4psfue/

An organization that is otherwise exempt from U.S. federal income tax is nonetheless subject to taxation with  respect  to  its  “unrelated  business  taxable  income”  (“UBTI”).  Subject  to  the  discussion  below  in “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,” all of the income realized by the Fund is expected to be short-term  or  long-term  capital  gain  income,  interest  income  or  other  passive  investment  income  of  the type  specifically  exempt  from  treatment  as  UBTI.  The  Fund  will  not  borrow  funds  for  the  purpose  of acquiring  or  holding  any  investments  or  otherwise  incur  “acquisition  indebtedness”  with  respect  to  such investments. Therefore, a tax-exempt entity purchasing Shares is not expected to incur any UBTI by reason of its investment in the Shares or upon sale of such Shares, provided that such tax-exempt entity does not borrow funds for the purpose of investing in the Shares",1649956653.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/u3ccbt/rate_m1s_aggressive_2060_tdf/i4q30ry/

If you have after tax 401k, then look into in-service distributions. You might be able to do what's called an IRA split rollover where your after tax 401k goes into a Roth IRA and any earnings go into Traditional IRA. Then you roll the traditional back into your 401k as needed.

[xposted from /r/investing],c2bws0c,"That looks pretty good - I do think you may be overcomplicating things unecessarily on the equities side, but that's just bookkeeping - nothing wrong at all that I can see on a fundamental level. You could simplify it to something like this without changing it much:

32% Toal US Stock Market Index
22% US Small Cap Index
22% Total International Stock Market index

Note: I left out REITs because they are riskier and correlated with small value (and you already have quite a bit of a value tilt there). It's all personal preference, to some extent, but I think splitting out growth from value is probably not worthwhile - splitting out is generally most useful if it gets you something fundamentally different or a significant tilt.

As to what you have vs. just Total Stock and Total Bond - I think the latter would be fine, too, though having international is IMHO pretty important (so you might use Total World), and TIPS do add some benefits too, but aren't essential.",1313131988.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/jg0yt/my_portfolio_and_three_more_simplelazy_portfolios/c2bws0c/
Commodities,Bogleheads,jg0yt,My portfolio and three more simple/lazy portfolios I really like - have any that *you* want to share? [xposted from /r/investing],c2mssbv,"Well, I can give you an idea of the first (differences) - the second one is a bit subjective (which is better) ;)

**Value vs. Growth (VBR vs. VBK)** - there are many debates around this, but basically: value is the 'cheap stuff' - the unloved, possibly poorer-performing companies. Growth is the 'good stuff' - companies that are rising (or risen) stars. Historic returns suggest you are rewarded for buying value over growth, *especially* in small-cap territory. That is not true for *all* time periods, but for most it is - in fact, some investors (myself included) specifically avoid small-cap growth ... no one is sure why it underperforms, but some speculate it is the 'IPO effect' of lots of snazzy up-and-coming little companies, many of which subsequently flop. On that bases, *I'd avoid VBK and lean toward VBR - especially if this is in a retirement account where taxes aren't a factor.*

**600 - VIOO** - the volume (i.e. # of people trading it) is too low, IMHO, to consider it (could mean high discounts or premiums when you want to by/sell) - plus it doesn't have a mutual fund share class (i.e. an equivalent, tied-in VG mutual fund). It is similar, just a slightly different index and thus tilt, to the small-cap blend ETF VB.

**Blend - VB** - for a pure small tilt, no weight toward value or growth, this is *the* fund in the industry for volume/expenses. Personally, I want a value tilt too so I use the mutual-fund equivalent of VBR.

**So for me, personally, it goes like this: VBR > VB > VIOO > VBK**

Footnote: If you want to learn more about value vs. growth, I recommend reading up on Fama & French's Three Factor Model, which suggests that there is a diversification benefit, potentially, to 'tilting' toward small and/or value. For simplicity, I like doing that in one fund by holding Small Cap Value. However, value and small are riskier as well as reward-ier, so holding more of those *should* ideally be balanced by having less in the market, depending on personal goals/tolerances (e.g. hold more bonds to balance it out).",1317079924.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/jg0yt/my_portfolio_and_three_more_simplelazy_portfolios/c2mssbv/

I actually have a bit of overlaps as a tilter myself. My philosophy is: fewer funds = easier to manage and less temptation to tinker at the wrong time (plus sometimes cheaper, since it means hitting admiral shares sooner, etc...).

So for instance, I get both a small and value tilt by adding a Small Value Index to a Total Stock Index - they do overlap a bit (after all, Small Value is a subset of Total Stock) but the net effect is what I'm aiming for, and to *avoid* overlap would be very tricky (and likely involve leaving some gaps).

I *also* have seen a lot of people regret buying more funds than they ended up wanting, and then being stuck with cap gains and unable to sell those funds (at least in taxable accounts). So if you're not 100% sure, my advice is to start simple (something like Total US/Total Intl/Total Bond like you mentioned) then tilt away if/when you want to - adding tilts isn't urgent, and isn't hard, but removing them can be ;)",1313545709.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/jg0yt/my_portfolio_and_three_more_simplelazy_portfolios/c2d0acq/
