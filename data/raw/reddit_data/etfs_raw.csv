n162xjs,"For younger investors, moderate use of leverage *looks* optimal when you backtest rolling periods, even if you wipe out youre still young and are buying into those crashes and going very far in gains. Papers by authors like Ayers and Nalebuff show this very well.

Lets be honest, even 100% equities is tough for most people. There were ample doomer panican posts in early april after liberation day. Many people who bought into index funds were shitting bricks at a mere 19% drawdown. Holding SPUU as a 2x S&P500 LETF would probably cause some people heart attacks. Think they can handle regular 40%+ drawdowns? A 20% market correction is not uncommon and will happen like a dozen times in your life.

Most people dont understand LETFs. They dont understand total return swaps, they dont understand futures, they dont understand that a 2x LETF is gonna have 1.1x swap exposure and have to pay the SOFR rate + a counter party risk spread as an endogenous fee deducted from the NAV, like a much larger extra expense ratio, of which LETFs already have large expense ratii. 

If youre emotionally stable and robotic in your investing and aware of all the nuance, absolutely using LETFs as an easy leverage form or box spreads or LEAPs to get leveraged index exposure, its a fantastic idea. Like, doing VTI LEAPs and EFA and EEM LEAPs to make your own leveraged VT essentially, using box spreads in a similar fashion, or simply taking a major LETF like UPRO to increase S&P500 exposure, buying international and some bonds, then rebalancing between the asset classes quarterly. ""Return stacking"" with diversified uncorrelated asset classes. These are all great ideas.

We have other boutique products that are structured very efficiently and smartly, like NTSX/NTSI/NTSE, which will really start to pop once we have a normalized yield curve. 

RSSB which is basically 100/100 VT/IEF.

GDE, which is 90/90 SPY/Gold futures, only 0.2 expense ratio and pays roughly 0.8 × EFFR per year for the gold futures.

n16ouef,">When back testing over a 50-year time

leveraged ETFs did not exist in 1975, and what appears to work in an abstract hypothetical sense may nor work in reality. many very smart people have blown themselves up with clever math that didn't play out as they anticipated. 

leveraged ETFs are very clearly described in the fact sheet and prospectus as for short-term trading and not long-term investing. the fact sheets say that these ETFs can deviate substantially from their underlying index, and should not be expected to track the index over long periods. 

Jack Schwager has a chapter on leveraged ETFs in his book *Market Sense and Nonsense*. To quote: 

>The failure of investors to understand the negative consequences of volatility on return can lead to unpleasant surprises. A good example of this phenomenon is the experience of many investors who buy leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs). **Typically, investors who buy a leveraged (2×) ETF expect to earn twice the amount as in the corresponding unleveraged ETF if the market advances. Over any extended period of time, however, they typically find the return is less than twice the amount if the market advances and the loss more than twice the amount if the market declines. Analogous comments would apply to leveraged short ETFs—that is, the gains on market declines will tend to be less than twice the market decline and the losses on price advances will tend to be more than twice the price rise.**

He uses examples from 2006 to 2011, a highly volatile period for the S&P 500: 

>“The performance difference between seemingly similar exposures in leveraged ETFs and their underlying index counterparts can be shockingly large—a reality that is not understood by many investors in these products. To illustrate this crucial point, we will focus on ETFs for the S&P 500—the most prominent equity index. Note in Figure 5.1 that while a 2× leveraged investment in the S&P 500 index ETF (SPY) declined by 4 percent during 2007–2011, the 2× leveraged Ultra S&P 500 ETF (SSO) lost over 41 percent during the same period. In other words, an investor who bought the leveraged index ETF would have lost 37 percent more than an investor who bought the unleveraged index on 50 percent margin—a position with seemingly equivalent exposure on dollars invested. 

>Even more surprising is the outcome of an investment in the UltraShort S&P 500 ETF (SDS), which one might have expected to gain in a net declining market. As shown in Figure 5.2, the leveraged short ETF (SDS) lost even more than the leveraged long ETF (SSO), sliding 58 percent—a 62 percent underperformance vis-à-vis the 4 percent gain in a 2× leveraged short position in the index.

>**Finally, consider an investor who bought equal amounts of both the leveraged long and short ETFs (that is, equal long positions in the SSO and SDS). Although this combined investment sounds like a neutral holding in which the two positions should approximately offset each other, the reality is radically different. The combined investment would have lost the equivalent of 99 percent, measured relative to the amount invested in each ETF!**

n1r4p57,"""dividend"" is not a relevant investment method, when measuring risk vs return. The dividend yield or dividend characteristics of a fund or stock is not predictive of how much wealth its going to make you and the risk involved with that investment.

VWRA is a total world ETF.

The dividend subs are saying ""SCHD is better then VWRA"" when they should be comparing SCHD to the US market. Theyre comparing dividend funds that only existed post 2009, in the era of extreme US stock outperformance, and then comparing it to a total world fund. This is comparing apples to pickles, not even oranges.

And then theres the covered call ETFs, that sell derivative contracts to give up future gains for cash today which they return to shareholders as yield. In a vacuum, these funds would be expected to return similarly to their underlying long term, but with lower volatility, but the problem is that in high volatility environments (losing out on large upside swings) plus the costs and frictions involved with bid ask spreads and market making, covered call yield ETFs will *always* create less wealth for you in the long run than just holding the underlying.

The main problem with leverage is the downside. If there is a market crash, then the leveraged ETF will crash harder than the unleveraged version.

Just like when you would invest in stocks (e.g., even in an index fund tracking the S&P 500), you could be down for a few years if you invested at a peak, in the same way, you could be down for even longer if you invested in leveraged stocks at a peak.

The upside is much higher and the downside is much lower. In the long run, leveraged ETFs tracking broad market index funds can beat the market so long as the leverage isn't too high.

nex1lpu,"I don't disagree with you on volatility decay as a major risk of LETFs but picking an example of a single stock as your ETF is a poor choice due to its very high volatility, and potentially leads to selection bias.

If you choose a LETF that is already highly diversified, the outcomes are much far favorable for LETFs.

For example, here's the same backtest you used but using S&P ETF vs. 2 x S&P ETF:

[S&P vs. 2x S&P](https://testfol.io/?s=fhBT7TG8YaM) (https://testfol.io/?s=fhBT7TG8YaM)

There are obviously periods of time following major stock market crashes in dot-com 2000 and GFC in 2008 where 2x LETF would underperform, but it would more than recover during longer bull runs.

nev9ug5,"Volatility drag is a good point but isn't a valid reason by itself because it's also applicable to stocks vs cash. (If the market drops by 10% and then gains 10% and you start with $100, you will end up with $99. The -$1 is volatility drag. If you hadn't invested in the market at all and just held $100, you would have 0 volatility drag - but that's not an argument not to invest in 100% stocks over a long time horizon, which is a leverage of 1x.)

Of course, higher leverage => higher volatility drag, but as long as the leverage beats out the volatility drag over a long time horizon (which it does for 100% stocks historically (1x leverage), and even up to 2x leverage in the last several decades in the US stock market), then the volatility drag is not an issue.

It probably does not have a place in most portfolios. 

It’s best use, in my opinion, is to efficiently reach a desired amount of leverage particularly to implement alt strategies or bonds/fixed income. For example, you could run 100% equity (or a beta of 1) allocating 20% UPRO and 40% to other equities while still having enough cash leftover for 40% bonds or trend following etc. Volatility will still be high but that’s a simple example of how it could be used in a portfolio with long investment horizon. I’d prefer if the levered component could be spread across US/ExUS for this approach which would mildly reduce the volatility coming from that sleeve of the portfolio. 

I personally use a different route and use portable alpha funds like AQR fusion to leverage my portfolio but you have to eat large fees and have less control on the allocations. However, this approach can reach similar amounts of leverage as above while increasing the total returns without driving the overall volatility of the portfolio up to stomach turning levels.

Two things here:

1. Plenty of people do. That's a fairly normal thing to do in the event that you sell a house, get an inheritance, or some other way acquire a large lump sum of money all at once.

2. Even if no one did that, your information here would be entirely irrelevant for the purpose of determining your investment decisions. A backtest with additional contributions over time doesn't tell you more information about the general performance of a particular asset compared to a backtest without additional contributions. All that's doing is giving more weight to whatever happened most recently in time. If the most recent set of events was a bull market, it will make all the contributions before the bull market look better - by contrast, if the most recent set of events was a bear market it will make all the contributions before the bear market look much worse.

So all a DCA backtest shows me is that the last 15 years have been a bull market - which we already knew. It doesn't give us better information about how TQQQ can be expected to perform (with or without additional contributions).

??? You haven't outlined a ""strategy"" at all.

Whether or not it's okay for you to have 10-15% leverage depends on what the rest of your portfolio is doing. What's your portfolio's max drawdown, volatility, and average return *now*? How do you anticipate 15% leverage will affect those metrics? Do you have any plan in mind for what to do if it increases your drawdown or volatility to uncomfortable levels? Side note, what would ""uncomfortable levels"" even look like to you personally? Some people can light a cigar and watch a -80% drawdown with their feet up.

lpxl54i,"Personally, I’m all for having a smaller portion of your broader portfolio allocated as a combination of LETFs. 

The issue is imo the volatility. Saying it is suboptimal for buy and hold would be an understatement. To workaround that, you have to incorporate other uncorrelated assets to reduce the risk of drawdowns and leverage those too. 

For example, up until 2022 TLT (or its 3X counterpart TMF) was highly inversely correlated with UPRO which was a great thing because when UPRO had big drawdowns, TMF would go up significantly to support your portfolio. Combine this with rebalancing, you always had some money disposable to further buy and were in a nutshell “buying low-selling high”. Then 2022 came and all that went out the window and the original HFEA strategy busted big time. Now you had an asset class that didn’t do its job of hedging and just kept on going down along with UPRO. 

After 2022, some strats diversified into even more classes, namely managed futures and gold (or leveraged gold, which is very bizarre from a theory standpoint) in addition to TMF. But who’s to say that another 2022-like event won’t happen in the near future that also blows those strats out too? Sure they backtest perfectly fine, but are you fine with potentially having 60-70% of your portfolio wiped when you’re say 10 years away from retirement?

The way I see it, it’s wise to have the majority of your portfolio dedicated to “traditional” safe investments like VT or an AWP (40-30-20-10 Equity, bonds, futures, gold) or whatever floats your boat, and allocate  a smaller percentage (say 20% maybe max 30% imo) to LETFs, transitioning to safer alternatives as you build capital/get older whichever comes first. If they work as intended, you get a big leg up on the competition. If not, no biggie you still have the rest of your portfolio to fall back to and not touch LETFs ever again lol. 

YOLO’ing 100% into UPRO or SSO (even with DCA) is really just gambling, and if you backtest this for any long time frame you’ll see it does significantly worse. If you’re going to do this, just buying VT will probably have you in a better position down the road.",1727845668,1,ETFs,1fu5lxq,/r/ETFs/comments/1fu5lxq/why_not_allocate_a_smallish_to_a_letf_leveraged/lpxl54i/

What tends to happen with them is that you see glorious gains and then they obliterate themselves. The important thing is to have some method of capturing those gains before the crash. I just skim any amount above a threshold that I have set when things are up and recharge it with new contributions when things are down. You don't have to do that, but you do have to do something.

mprnyba,"So generally speaking for a 3x product you do need something to offset the drawdown - 3x looks good on recent backtests because of how long our bull run has been recently but 2x is still better overall if that's the only thing you're holding.

Here's a link to a simulation of 3x VT, 2x VT, 3x with 10 Gold, 3x with 10 Gold and 10 an intermediate treasury fund, and finally just using cash as the diversified (which really is just reducing the volatility and implied negative cash holdings from the leverage)

[https://testfol.io/?s=cXiFgVNLOub](https://testfol.io/?s=cXiFgVNLOub)

I chose 1975 to allow for a realistic time for when gold wasn't in an unusual spot (illegal to own or being part of our monetary system) and monthly inflows of $1000 to have the MWR (money-weighted returns) be relevant and made everything inflation-adjusted because of the time frame. Feel free to play around with inputs, but don't rely on them too much for ""optimizing"" small differences since the past isn't the same as the future.

You'll notice that 3x leads for a bit but gets so totally blown up during downturns or volatility that it's not worthwhile. Adding just a small slice of another asset helped make up that performance difference between 2x and 3x very quickly. I used a plain gold and bond fund since everyone knows funds for those with minimal research + I don't want to be responsible for suggesting specific ones to you. If you also play around with the numbers you'll see that less is very much more for the 3x product - try setting it to just 70% instead.

Stepping back - the big advantage 3x has over 2x is that you can allocate more into the diversifiers, not the raw performance if you only have a portfolio of one or another.

The summary is that I would suggest something liquid in a portfolio that is very diversifying. Preferably at least two. Longer bonds, Gold, some sort of MF Trend program, a market neutral long-short strategy, or even just a small allocation to a direct tail-hedge product. An all-weather fund could also work.

ncnk58k,"Thats wrong. You dont *decay* over night. So called ""volatility decay"" is a consequence of daily percent movements compounding, which in math has negative moves more important than positives. For example, a mere 50% drawdown requires a 100% gain to recover.

The ""decay"" is a simple mathematical identity. If you gain 1% and lose 1% in the stock market over two separate days, you end up at 99.99% of your initial dollar. This ""decay"" exists in unlevered equities as well. It only becomes a problem because we make assumptions about mean reversion in unlevered indices of stocks, but these need not hold true in daily leveraged expressions of these indices because daily leverage introduces path dependence of returns.

If you had an LETF, that differential is larger. +3% and -3% lands you at 99.91%. A larger loss. Thats what the ""decay"" is 

The term is actually called beta slippage. Thats because day to day compounding isnt just negative. If you have +1% days three days in a row, the underlying is at 3.03% gain, but a 3x LETF is at 9.27% gain. 3.03% gain × 3 is only 9.09% gain, but 9.27% gain is larger than that.

lori638,"The answer is nuanced. It’s probably not the greatest idea to hold a 100% equity leveraged portfolio unless you don’t have any risk aversion and are also very young.

However, leveraged ETFs can be thoughtfully used to hold a diversified portfolio at a higher level of risk.

For example, NTSX is basically a US 60/40 stocks/bonds portfolio leveraged by 1.5 (so it’s basically a 90/60 portfolio).

You can also use them for return stacking: being exposed to alternative asset classes without giving up the returns of traditional asset classes.

For example, if you want to hold a 60/40 portfolio, but you also want to hold gold, commodities, managed futures, etc., you can invest in 66.67% NTSX (it’s got some international equivalents) and 33.34% in the other investments. This way you get the 60/40 portfolio plus 33% of something else.

Another example would be using 20% UPRO (3x S&P500) and 20% UST (2x intermediate Treasuries) and use the other 60% to invest in some other uncorrelated asset.

This way you could either have similar expected returns (long term) to a 100% stocks portfolio with less risk or have higher expected returns with the same lever of volatility and probably smaller drawdowns.

A tenet of modern portfolio theory is that you should look for the optimal portfolio that gives the best returns for the level of risk taken and the use leverage or cash to increase or decrease the risk.

Let me put it to you this way, if you started 3X S&P500 leveraged investing the beginning of 2000, it would take you 20 years to break even. You'd have done better to just invest in VOO all the way to today's closing price. You'd have almost double the balance today with VOO instead of 3x leveraged.

The problem with leveraging is a single drawdown can reduce your balance to almost zero. We're talking about a 98% drawdown! It then takes decades to recover from that.

If time it right get in and out at the right time, and it's a bull market, you can make money, but if not, you could lose almost all of it.

* behavioral reasons - it is really hard for most people to withstand a big drawdown with an unlevered equity-ETF. Now multiply that with leverage. Selling at the wrong times and/or do no new contribtions when discount rates are the highest is a huge risk for most people. Before a big drawdown everyong says they can handle the downturns.
* risks of closure of the levered fund - this can trigger a taxable event and would be bad for compounding. The risk of closing of some levered fund is probably higher than for a unlevered ""normal"" ETF that has a lot of AUM.

k4i1c0y,">also I understand volatility drag.

not sure you do understand it. 

the prospectuses for all these ETFs warn you in very clear, simple wording that they're not intended for long-term holding: 

>These leveraged ETFs seek a return that is 300% or -300% of the return of their benchmark index *for a single day*. **The funds should not be expected to provide three times or negative three times the return of the benchmark’s cumulative return for periods greater than a day.** https://www.direxion.com/product/daily-sp-500-bull-bear-3x-etfs

>I also tried the worst case scenario, getting in at 1930,

1930 to 2023 is not the worst-case scenario. at least not for an individual. very few people investing in 1930 were alive in 2023. Walter Schloss is perhaps the closest to that span as a professional, he started in the 1930s IIRC and died in 2012. and you couldn't really invest in the S&P 500 until the 1970s. But I digress. 

the worst case is when the S&P 500 didn't break even for 29 years after the peak in 1929, or didn't break even for 23 years after the peak in 1965. https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SP500-Real-Price-vs-Periods-of-No-Returns-1024x555.jpg

run the numbers on these periods, not from Adam and Noah to today. 

>Maybe I’m missing something

go read *Market Sense and Nonsense* by Jack Schwager. He has an entire chapter on leveraged products. 

>**The performance difference between seemingly similar exposures in leveraged ETFs and their underlying index counterparts can be shockingly large—a reality that is not understood by many investors in these products.***

he goes on: 

>...**while a 2× leveraged investment in the S&P 500 index ETF (SPY) declined by 4 percent during 2007–2011, the 2× leveraged Ultra S&P 500 ETF (SSO) lost over 41 percent during the same period.**

it gets weirder: 

>“Finally, consider an investor who bought equal amounts of both the leveraged long and short ETFs (that is, equal long positions in the SSO and SDS [over the samer period of time[). Although this combined investment sounds like a neutral holding in which the two positions should approximately offset each other, the reality is radically different. The combined investment would have lost the equivalent of 99 percent, measured relative to the amount invested in each ETF!

The tricky part is to find such an underlying asset and stick with it.

k4ixe9p,"Volatility drag in relation to our discussion; the tendency for volatility in the underlying index to negatively impact performance. This is because even when the price of the non leveraged index returns to its previous price, the price of the leveraged position does not, since the amplified negative returns hurt the performance more than the positive returns improves it.

This would be best seen in an example of an index that loses 10% in one day, and gains 11.1% in the next. 

100\*0.9=90

90\*1.11=100

But the leveraged ETF would not have returned to the price

100\*0.8=80

80\*1.22=96.6

The fund achieved its goal of maintaining a 2x leverage, but its total return was not 2x. This is also why I understood to download every day, instead of every year or even month.

Please let me know if I have any misunderstanding.

I can also assure you I understand there will be a lot of deviation from the index compared to the LETF, because of a variety of reasons including volatility drag, tracking errors, and fees. If I have a misunderstanding, again, please let me know. 

I realized I calculated at buying at almost 32 in 1929, not sure why I said 1930. You're definitely right when you say it was not the worst times to get in or out of the market. It was definitely an exaggeration and plain wrong. However, if you want to look at extremely long timescales, 1929 to 2009, at the market top and bottom, would be undeniably be one of the worst times to buy and sell. I did this analysis in another comment. SPX had a \~3.9% CAGR and 2x SPX had a \~3.5% CAGR (including fees). 2x underperforms but I am happy with this result personally. I didn't calculate what would happen if I DCAed, but I would imagine 2x would have significantly outperformed.   


If I calculate with your times, 2x would have significantly underperformed, even not considering fees or even dividends, at around 0.25 of SPX. Again, though, this isn't a DCA evaluation. 

I would pride myself in being able to reconsider my views when I think I'm wrong, and I have been reconsidering a lot. I have made no investments into LETFs. Comparing the performance to the NASDAQ, and maybe it's simply best to hold high growth investments to even more risky LETFs. 

Then again, 2x NDX has a staggering performance. I just downloaded every single day's performance of NDX, and the CAGR for 2x is \~20%, including 1% fees. Normal NDX is \~13.7. Doesn't include dividends, but the CAGR speaks for itself in this case in my opinion. Of course if you buy at 2000 and sell at 2009 it would be absolutely devastating for your investment, but I'm almost 100% convinced if you DCA 10-20% into LETFs it would have low risk  (not relative to 80/20 portfolio of SPY and BND of course) and have incredible performance. At the very least reinvesting dividends into some LETFs would be a good idea.

Of course, like I mentioned, I personally think and hope I am willing to have a flexible mindset, so if there's something I'm missing let me know. If these results are accurate why aren't more people investing into LETFs? I cannot answer this question myself so I believe there has to be something I'm missing, so again, please let me know. The only things I can think about is risk of not being able to retire or pull money out quick due to a bad market, since the stdev is so high. I feel like I sound like a crazy trader who buys Tesla with leverage or OTM options, but I really cannot see what's wrong with my analysis.",1697088739,1,ETFs,174r5jl,/r/ETFs/comments/174r5jl/whats_the_problem_with_leveraged_etfs/k4ixe9p/

I respect The Plain Bagel and have watched his videos for some time, but his video on leveraged ETFs is misinformed and the arguments are hollow. There are three arguments that he uses:

1. Negative returns are more impactful than positive returns.

This is true, but he never actually said how much negative return is too much or what is the optimal leverage.

>A 3x leveraged ETF would go bust if it went down by more than 33.33% in a single day.

He says this as if it is a possibility, but at least for the S&P 500, this has never happened, especially with circuit breakers that prevents it going down more than 20% in a single day. Some cataclysm event must happen for it to go down by more than 33.33%, but you would have much bigger problems at that point.

>3. Leveraged ETFs perform worse during sideways markets.

True, but is again another nothing argument as he doesn't consider what the optimal leverage would be such that it performs better than its unlevered counterpart in the long term despite doing worse during sideways markets.

He says at the beginning that financial professionals advise against the use of leveraged ETFs for long term holding, but the evidence says otherwise.

TL;DR : YOU NEVER WIN IN THE LONG TERM




You got the basic ETF spot on.

Say you have an ETF tracking an index with two stocks: 

Stock A value $50, Stock B value $50. ETF NAV is $100. We will assume NAV = market price for simplicity.

You now invest $100  in it. The ETF itself immediately buys 1 more share of each stock. That's how the ETF value is tied to underlying assets. 
Stock A price goes up $1, ETF NAV goes up $1, your holding goes up $1.

Now leveraged ETF. You want to track 2x. 
You invest $100, stock A goes up $1, and you want your portfolio to increase by $2.

To do this, the ETF now needs to have the equivalent of 2 stocks for each one in the index. They do this through futures, options, etc. This is expensive as they need to borrow money to do this ( since you refused to invest more than $100). And risky.

How they manage risk, is they take profits and losses DAILY. And the next day, they recalculate the formula and start off a little lower than last night and take a little bit off you.( Who's going to pay for the borrowing cost?)
THIS IS WHAT KILLS YOU.

If stocks go up EVERY DAY, you make some profit. ANYTHING else, and the formula is designed to for the NAV to go down. If you lose 1% today, you need to make up 2% tomorrow. YOU NEVER WIN IN THE LONG TERM",1696978405,5,ETFs,174r5jl,/r/ETFs/comments/174r5jl/whats_the_problem_with_leveraged_etfs/k4cbbd5/

What do the results show If you backtest from the great depression to somewhere after 1999? 2008? Do the risk adjusted returns even show better results than no leverage? It's not just about the final return, but for example, are the Sharpe and sortino ratios better or even good enough to justify whatever return you get adjusted for risk?

If you think we have another 10+ year long bull run coming, then go for it. But like I said, the economy is cyclical. I'm not sure you want to be the guy who lump sums into a leveraged ETF at what appears to be the beginning of a new cycle, SPY itself has stagnated for the last 2 years.

Therefore it usually takes more positive days to make up for the negative days. Buying and holding a leveraged ETF during periods of high volatility or bear markets will hurt more than they'll help. Generally. 

For example, a stock is trading at 500 and drops 10% to 450. The next day it rises by 10%, but now that's 10% of 450 so were at 495. The more that pattern repeats, the more it falls away from its ATH. Leveraged ETFs will magnify that effect, which is why they are not designed to buy and hold long term.

We can be fairly certain that if a dot com occured again (but lets be honest, thats not likely), TQQQ would have closed up shop.

More realistic worst case is a GFC-esque meltdown, causing herds of investors to flee the markets and cause valuations to severely correct, maybe by -55% again like 2008-2009. In this scenario, TQQQ drops -94.72%. Again, this could cause swap agreements to be closed and the fund would have to wrap up. Maybe they stay open, maybe they dont. Still, thats -95% loss. Even kathy wood couldnt get that.

And when looking at past performance of these things, do *not* forget that those CAGR's are heavily influenced by 15 years of large cap growth gobsmacking outperformance and a 30+% bull run this year. End it in 2022 and it doesnt look so great, TQQQ would have a negative 23 yr CAGR..

1. You need to have an insanely high tolerance for risk. Most investors overestimate their tolerance for risk.

lcf0wjl,"Consensus is broadly:

1.5-2x leverage is the sweet spot for getting stuff done. It really depends on what you're levering. For example, NTSX offers a 60/40 stocks/bonds portfolio levered 1.5x which is nice. 

If you direct hold 3x or 4x levered equities, you will lose it all eventually when buying and holding. It's inevitable. It's not a question of if, but when. If it happens early, it's less of a problem. If it happens after 20 years, you can go from 2 million to 200k real quick. Holding higher levered products requires hedges like long treasuries, managed futures, maybe gold, and often requiring at least quarterly rebalancing, thus these things are normally done in tax advantaged accounts.

For DCA long term leverage, likely you'll have to stick with a classic like SSO (2x VOO), which will only do better than the udnerlying in bull markets because the cost of leverage is embedded in the total return as well as the higher expense ratio.

Or you can lever with something like NTSX/E/I so you can get bonds exposure without losing much equity exposure.

h2u4g0r,"Here's how I understand it.
We have 2 equal positions, $100 of both TQQQ and QQQ.

Day 1: great day in the market. QQQ rises 10%, so TQQQ rises 30%. Our values are as follows:

QQQ - $110
TQQQ - $130

Day 2: Maybe day 1 was a bit intense. There's a sharp pull back of exactly 10%. Now our position looks like this:

QQQ - $99
TQQQ - $91

Remember, if QQQ loses money, that loss is amplified by TQQQ. Even though a 10% gain followed by a 10% loss looks like it should be a wash, we are losing more money because we are taking the 2nd day percentage from a higher amount.

Day 3&4: A 5% gain day for QQQ means a 15% gain for TQQQ. 

QQQ - $103.95
TQQQ - $104.65

QQQ - $109.15
TQQQ - $120.35

As we can see with QQQ rising, TQQQ rises even faster. If we continue having good days, our total return will be greater than 3x because our amounts are compounding over time.

Day 5 - uh oh. Market crash. QQQ loses 30%, which means TQQQ loses 90%.

QQQ - $76.40
TQQQ - $12.03

Even if the following day we have a 100% return on the QQQ (300% for TQQQ), our balances only look like this:

QQQ - $152.80
TQQQ - $36.09

It's going to take a very long time for our TQQQ holding to return to it's starting balance of $100. 


When a constant growth in the NASDAQ is occuring, life is good. Because of compounding, we are making more than 3x our money using TQQQ, which easily covers for the higher fees and lack of dividend. It's when there's a big correction or downturn that we run into issues. And remember, even if we are trading sideways (days 1 and 2), we are going to be losing money faster with TQQQ. TQQQ is really on effective if markets are continuously going up.

I'm not an expert so if I'm wrong, someone feel free to correct me (politely please, I'm sensitive), but this is how I understand it. From what I've read, it sounds like holding TQQQ up to a year can be a legitimate strategy, but putting it in your retirement account for 30 years down the road is more than likely a mistake.

Perhaps making 5 to 10% of your portfolio TQQQ would be a clever way to outpace the market, but don't allocate too much to such a leveraged fund. 

Also, many people don't know this but leveraged ETFs don't get taxed as long term capital gains. They get taxed like regular income so that may also discourage a lot of people from using TQQQ.",1624506182,15,ETFs,o6phre,/r/ETFs/comments/o6phre/qqq_vs_tqqq_why_would_i_not_pick_tqqq/h2uja1q/

h2vykzr,"First, you have to understand what leveraging means. Second, you understand it's about risk versus reward. Third, and very importantly, you have to understand that investment/trading is influenced by human psychology.

In a simplest way of leveraging, let's say have $100, and you borrow $200 dollars to invest in QQQ. That's 3x leveraging.  If QQQ goes up 10%, your entire investment goes up $330.  Now, if the $200  loan is interest-free, you pay that back, have $130 left.  That's a 30% return in your $100.  That's 3x leveraging.   If the loan is not interest free, you deduct that from your ROI.   The people who manage TQQQ use financial instruments in ways to minimize interest to achieve a 3x leverage as much as possible.

It's high risk and high reward.  If you buy at all time high, and QQQ goes down and never comes back up for a long time, you lose money 3x that much, more or less.

BUT.... investment is a human game, played by mortals. Those of us who lived through the March 2020 crash understood this very well.  SP500 dropped 21% and things got quite interesting.  Folks sold at the bottom.  Others waited for the bottom, not believing it had happened yet, claiming March 27, 2020 was a ""dead cat bounce"".  I bet you there are still people waiting for the COVID crash to happen again.

Most of us believe that QQQ may drop in the short term, but over the long term it will go up.  But let's say another disaster hit, QQQ drops 30%, will this belief still hold, or are you going to sell?

What I am contesting is the claim that “you never get the return indicated in the chart.” If by chart you mean price history, I’m pretty freaking sure that I can sell the security at the market price it is listed as currently trading at, and thus “get the return the chart says I would” relative to the price I bought the security at.

h2zn11a,"Hey Numba. I replied to you in a previous comment, but now I see your data I can see where the confusion is coming from. While QQQ can definitely drop 33% (as you have shown), it does not drop 33% in a single day, so you would be saved from a wipeout by the daily reset. I am not sure how to explain it best other than reiterate that the leverage is reset daily (and not over any period such as May 31 2008 to Feb 28 2009) and use an example. 

If QQQ goes down 1% in a day, then TQQQ goes down 3%. I think we are okay with this. The next day, things are reset and we start again from scratch. Another 1% downturn in QQQ causes TQQQ to go down another 3%.You can do this thought experiment again and again with any percentage drop you like, but you can see to get wiped out (a 100% drop in TQQQ) you would need to observe a 33% drop in QQQ in a single day. 

TQQQ is indeed a very risky investment, but you shouldn't get wiped out. The biggest ever daily drop in NASDAQ was ~12%. (Yes, NASDAQ is not exactly QQQ but it's the best data I could find quickly).

ma2i78b,"The folks at return stacked put out good explanatory content.

Obviously yes, theyre advertising their business and trying to demystify the use of leverage in a portfolio. Beta slippage (the general case of volatility decay) looks like this. Here is a standard thing youll find in a prospectus for a leveraged ETF.

https://preview.redd.it/l6vlstcyt6ge1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=58df5f9bf31863a1b1dee015dd883c0e91843710

Given the typically strong equity risk premium we have observed, the consequence of ""volatility decay"" has been LETF returns that crush unlevered stocks, even when backtested over a century (for the S&P500). Long long term, when you include devastating events like the great depression, 2x returned better than 3x.

These instruments are *risky*. And you have to pay the cost of leverage, which is gradually deducted from the NAV like a second bigger expense ratio. Despite these costs and mechanistic concerns, there is a wealth of literature out there by the likes of Ayers and Nalebuff on Lifecycle allocation, or Leverage for the long run by Michael Gayed, or statistical models like from Scott cedarburg who suggested the optimal strategy on a globally diversified equity / bond portfolio would not only be 100% equity (for the highest Safe Withdrawal Rate) but likely would be long stocks in excess of 100%.

Risk is definitely for the young, and using leverage to free up space in the portfolio while simultaneously remaining at least 100% exposed to diversified equities is amazingly powerful, especially when combining and rebalancing between uncorrelated assets like stocks, long bonds, gold, non-equity futures, etc.

You can do it yourself with plain LETF, or companies like Return Stacked, Wisdom Tree, and PIMCO offer bespoke products that can do it for you.",1738267576,5,ETFs,1idv50m,/r/ETFs/comments/1idv50m/letfs_rebalance_drag_everyone_should_read/ma2i78b/

ma2lcew,"""The Market portfolio is the theoretically optimal for the average investor.

The “average” in this case is the dollar weighted average. This average investor holds the market by definition. And under the EMH it is the most diversified for said agent.

Per ICAPM theory you tilt away from the market cap weighted portfolio depending on how you’re different than average. Assuming that shocks to the wealth of key financial institutions are vastly different to shocks to wealth of retail investors, than we can load up on those assets that negatively covary with the wealth of thise key institutions without a huge amount of harm to gain excess returns.

Like for example, key financial institutions often times are **mandated** to hold safe assets like government bonds. This is one partial explanation as to why the equity risk premiums is so high, and a theoretical framework for investors to hold equities far in excess of their market cap weights.

100% equities is still overweighting equities, since you have to consider the *entire universe* of liquid accessible investments, like bonds and commodities and such. The bond market is bigger than the stock market.

Still, using mild leverage on equities using institutional lending rates (LETFs let you borrow at the SOFR rate plus a counter party risk spread, assume thats SOFR + \~.5%) has generated amazing returns, and when couples with negatively correlated assets like long treasury bonds, you cna produce portfolios with excess total returns *and* risk adjusted returns.

An example in practice of a fund that put their money where their mouth is would be PSLDX, which is essentially 2x leverage with 100/100 S&P500 / Long Corporate Bonds.

It came out in 2007, right before the GFC. Despite the 2x leverage? Still had an identical drawdown to the S&P500 of -55%. It then went on to crush it.

But there's a good guiding principle I borrowed ferrum Cliff Asness: Get your exposures as efficiently as you can.

Let's look at just RSST vs using UPRO. If we estimate the trend portion of RSST runs at ~13.5% vol, what would you need from a separate fund to achieve this if using UPRO for beta exposure? 1/3 of your dollars are in UPRO, so you only get 2/3 of your dollars for managed futures. 13.5%/(2/3) = 13.5%*1.5 = 20.25%. There isn't a fund with this high volatility, so it's not really possible to get apples to apples there. PLUS, UPRO has its own fee, so you're paying extra there. PLUS UPRO has extra borrowing costs embedded above risk free that you're having to pay. PLUS, the standalone managed futures fund holds a bunch of extra tbills which create tax drag.

You have to understand something. And I feel like nobody realizes this. 

If your portfolio loses 50 percent one month, and then gains 50 percent the next month, that’s not breakeven. 100 becomes 50, which then becomes 75. You’re still down 25 percent. 

Now multiply that effect by 3. At some point, you will experience a bear market and when the above affect is multiplied by 3, you will lose a magnified amount, and when the underlying recovers fully, you will be nowhere near recovered. Please see why:

Consider that a 30 percent bear market loses you 90%. **If you lose 90%, (a million becomes 100,000), what do you need to get back to a million?  You need 10x returns or 1000% returns**. Think about this:

in order to recover from a 30% negetive run of the underlying (90% loss to you), you need the underlying to go up 333%. (1000% gain to you). But someone who was invested regularly and loses 30%, only needs a 42% positive run to return. So , when the market goes up 42% and fully recovers, as it always does, people invested in the underlying will be back to break even. Meanwhile your 100k remaining goes up 120%  and is now worth… 220k. 

Wait a minute… the market fully recovered, but your 1 million is still down 80%??? Yes. 

Does this explain why it’s not buy and hold? Volatility exponentially magnifies your losses compared to gains of the same amount. And the higher the losses, the more exponentially this effect is magnified. So the “market” always recovers yes, but that does not mean your levered principal does!!!! In fact, if you experience one single recession, you will spend the rest of your life fighting to get back to break even and most likely never will. This is a fact. And this is something that you do NOT see when you look at the “returns” of the levered etf. 

Everyone this is the key: *the market recovering fully will not mean your etf recovers fully! And the bigger the negetive dip is, the more behind market recovery you will be. As stated above, if the underlying goes down 30% , you will need it to go up 300 percent unlevered in order to recover whereas someone invested in the regular underlying will only need it to go up 42% for them to recover.*

If you ever experience a bear market, you are done. Especially if you are closer to retirement at that point. How long would it take your to recover from a 30% market dip where you need 300% market bull run to just break even? 

Therefore, the only way this is a winning buy and hold strategy for 40 years is if there is never another bear market ever again. 

People who think levered etfs are a buy and hold strategy don’t understand this magnified , exponential loss due to volatility. 

The “market” always recovers but YOUR PRINCIPAL does not. There is a difference.

Now this is the most important point, pay close attention. 

Lastly, say the market went down 32% instead of 30%. Now you lose 96% instead of 90 so your 1 million is now down to 40,000. So in order to recover to a million from that, you would need 25x returns or 2,500% returns, which means you would need over 800% unlevered market positive returns in order for you’re levered position to recover. 

Do you see how much more magnified this effect is just by adding 2% to the initial downswing? (From 30 to 32). A 30% unlevered market loss meant you needed 300% unlevered market returns to recover. But a 32% unlevered market loss means you need 800% unlevered market returns to recover.

Therefore, the only way this is a winning buy and hold strategy for 40 years is if there is never another bear market ever again. 

People who think levered etfs are a buy and hold strategy don’t understand this magnified , exponential loss due to volatility. They think a market recovery means full recovery for them when in reality a full market recovery leaves them down tewmendously. 

Now imagine experiencing 2 bear markets in your 40 year holding period? Most likely you will. And you will be left with pennies on the dollar regardless of what the “returns” look like on the fact sheet. 

The “market” always recovers but YOUR PRINCIPAL does not. There is a difference.

Now this is the most important point, pay close attention. 

Lastly, say the market went down 32% instead of 30%. Now you lose 96% instead of 90 so your 1 million is now down to 40,000. So in order to recover to a million from that, you would need 25x returns or 2,500% returns, which means you would need over 800% unlevered market positive returns in order for you’re levered position to recover from a 32% dip. 800/32 is 25x. **The loss is 25x more powerful then a gain of the same amount after the fact. 

Do you see how much more magnified this effect is just by adding 2% to the initial downswing I described earlier? (From 30 to 32). A 30% unlevered market loss meant you needed 300% unlevered market returns to recover. But a 32% unlevered market loss means you need 800% unlevered market returns to recover.

hat65fi,"No. You absolutely cannot. An investor in a 3x levered etf will not recover from one single bear market on their lifetimes. When the market fully recovers, your investment in the levered etf is still down HUGE. I demonstrate this clearly with math below: copied my earlier comment. 

No.  It has nothing to do with stomaching volatility. I can see not one actual explanation of why this is a losing bet so I am copying my comment in response to every single comment as a PSA to prevent people from ruining themselves. 

You have to understand something. And I feel like nobody realizes this. 

If your portfolio loses 50 percent one month, and then gains 50 percent the next month, that’s not breakeven. 100 becomes 50, which then becomes 75. You’re still down 25 percent. 

Now multiply that effect by 3. At some point, you will experience a bear market and when the above affect is multiplied by 3, you will lose a magnified amount, and when the underlying recovers fully, you will be nowhere near recovered. Please see why:

Consider that a 30 percent bear market loses you 90%. **If you lose 90%, (a million becomes 100,000), what do you need to get back to a million?  You need 10x returns or 1000% returns**. Think about this:

in order to recover from a 30% negetive run of the underlying (90% loss to you), you need the underlying to go up 333%. (1000% gain to you). But someone who was invested regularly and loses 30%, only needs a 42% positive run to return. So , when the market goes up 42% and fully recovers, as it always does, people invested in the underlying will be back to break even. Meanwhile your 100k remaining goes up 120%  and is now worth… 220k. 

Wait a minute… the market fully recovered, but your 1 million is still down 80%??? Yes. 

Does this explain why it’s not buy and hold? Volatility exponentially magnifies your losses compared to gains of the same amount. And the higher the losses, the more exponentially this effect is magnified. So the “market” always recovers yes, but that does not mean your levered principal does!!!! In fact, if you experience one single recession, you will spend the rest of your life fighting to get back to break even and most likely never will. This is a fact. And this is something that you do NOT see when you look at the “returns” of the levered etf. 

Everyone this is the key: *the market recovering fully will not mean your etf recovers fully! And the bigger the negetive dip is, the more behind market recovery you will be. As stated above, if the underlying goes down 30% , you will need it to go up 300 percent unlevered in order to recover whereas someone invested in the regular underlying will only need it to go up 42% for them to recover.* so, you need 7x returns (300/42) to catch up but the levered etf only gives you 3x… hmmm.

hat84p4,"No no no no. It absolutely will not work the way you describe. Say hypothetically the market dips 30%. You will need it to go up 333 percent (unlevered) in order to fully recover to break even whereas an unlevered investor would only need the market to go up 42% to fully recover. Now let’s say it originally dips 32 % instead of 30. Now, instead of needed 300% market unlevered returns to recover, you need 800% unlevered market returns to recover. 2 percent extra dip and you are 500% more behind.

So in order to recover to a million from that, you would need 25x returns or 2,500% returns, which means you would need over 800% unlevered market positive returns in order for you’re levered position to recover from a 32% dip. 800/32 is 25x. **The loss is 25x more powerful then a gain of the same amount after the fact. **

You have to understand something. And I feel like nobody realizes this. 

If your portfolio loses 50 percent one month, and then gains 50 percent the next month, that’s not breakeven. 100 becomes 50, which then becomes 75. You’re still down 25 percent. 

Now multiply that effect by 3. At some point, you will experience a bear market and when the above affect is multiplied by 3, you will lose a magnified amount, and when the underlying recovers fully, you will be nowhere near recovered. Please see why:

Consider that a 30 percent bear market loses you 90%. **If you lose 90%, (a million becomes 100,000), what do you need to get back to a million?  You need 10x returns or 1000% returns**. Think about this:

in order to recover from a 30% negetive run of the underlying (90% loss to you), you need the underlying to go up 333%. (1000% gain to you). But someone who was invested regularly and loses 30%, only needs a 42% positive run to return. So , when the market goes up 42% and fully recovers, as it always does, people invested in the underlying will be back to break even. Meanwhile your 100k remaining goes up 120%  and is now worth… 220k. 

Wait a minute… the market fully recovered, but your 1 million is still down 80%??? Yes. 

Does this explain why it’s not buy and hold? Volatility exponentially magnifies your losses compared to gains of the same amount. And the higher the losses, the more exponentially this effect is magnified. So the “market” always recovers yes, but that does not mean your levered principal does!!!! In fact, if you experience one single recession, you will spend the rest of your life fighting to get back to break even and most likely never will. This is a fact. And this is something that you do NOT see when you look at the “returns” of the levered etf. 

Everyone this is the key: *the market recovering fully will not mean your etf recovers fully! And the bigger the negetive dip is, the more behind market recovery you will be. As stated above, if the underlying goes down 30% , you will need it to go up 300 percent unlevered in order to recover whereas someone invested in the regular underlying will only need it to go up 42% for them to recover.*

If you ever experience a bear market, you are done. Especially if you are closer to retirement at that point. How long would it take your to recover from a 30% market dip where you need 300% market bull run to just break even?

> will not recover from on bear market

This is true IF you’re all in without a hedge. 100% TQQQ will knock you out and kill any chance you have at retiring. Literally no one suggests this. I’m not sure why you make the assumption that people need to be all in leveraged ETFs. The only safe way of doing that is to have a hedge like TMF. 

I advised that people carefully examine their selected strategy, this includes the basic understanding of percentages you seem obsessed with. You’re not wrong regarding them but your extreme examples only apply if the person is going all in leverage which only people willing to gamble their retirement do. 

If you’re under 30, you SHOULD have SOME leverage because you have so much time that you don’t need to be lucky. I always recommend that people have ~10-20% in something like UPRO if they’re young. You can also do the HFEA 55/45 UPRO/TMF which has been tested to death and is a great way to increase your returns if you’re young.

You have to understand something. And I feel like nobody realizes this. 

If your portfolio loses 50 percent one month, and then gains 50 percent the next month, that’s not breakeven. 100 becomes 50, which then becomes 75. You’re still down 25 percent. 

Now multiply that effect by 3. At some point, you will experience a bear market and when the above affect is multiplied by 3, you will lose a magnified amount, and when the underlying recovers fully, you will be nowhere near recovered. Please see why:

Consider that a 30 percent bear market loses you 90%. **If you lose 90%, (a million becomes 100,000), what do you need to get back to a million?  You need 10x returns or 1000% returns**. Think about this:

in order to recover from a 30% negetive run of the underlying (90% loss to you), you need the underlying to go up 333%. (1000% gain to you). But someone who was invested regularly and loses 30%, only needs a 42% positive run to return. So , when the market goes up 42% and fully recovers, as it always does, people invested in the underlying will be back to break even. Meanwhile your 100k remaining goes up 120%  and is now worth… 220k. 

Wait a minute… the market fully recovered, but your 1 million is still down 80%??? Yes. 

Does this explain why it’s not buy and hold? Volatility exponentially magnifies your losses compared to gains of the same amount. And the higher the losses, the more exponentially this effect is magnified. So the “market” always recovers yes, but that does not mean your levered principal does!!!! In fact, if you experience one single recession, you will spend the rest of your life fighting to get back to break even and most likely never will. This is a fact. And this is something that you do NOT see when you look at the “returns” of the levered etf. 

Everyone this is the key: *the market recovering fully will not mean your etf recovers fully! And the bigger the negetive dip is, the more behind market recovery you will be. As stated above, if the underlying goes down 30% , you will need it to go up 300 percent unlevered in order to recover whereas someone invested in the regular underlying will only need it to go up 42% for them to recover.*

If you ever experience a bear market, you are done. Especially if you are closer to retirement at that point. How long would it take your to recover from a 30% market dip where you need 300% market bull run to just break even? 

Therefore, the only way this is a winning buy and hold strategy for 40 years is if there is never another bear market ever again.

The “market” always recovers but YOUR PRINCIPAL does not. There is a difference.

Now this is the most important point, pay close attention. 

Lastly, say the market went down 32% instead of 30%. Now you lose 96% instead of 90 so your 1 million is now down to 40,000. So in order to recover to a million from that, you would need 25x returns or 2,500% returns, which means you would need over 800% unlevered market positive returns in order for you’re levered position to recover. 

Do you see how much more magnified this effect is just by adding 2% to the initial downswing? (From 30 to 32). A 30% unlevered market loss meant you needed 300% unlevered market returns to recover. But a 32% unlevered market loss means you need 800% unlevered market returns to recover.

hats4i9,thank you for this explanation.  I had a vague understanding of these leveraged ETFs and don't own any because they sounded like a bad idea.

hat7kgg,"No. More time decreases your odds of success 3x levered. Please see my copied comment below where I explain this with digestible math. 

No. You absolutely cannot. An investor in a 3x levered etf will not recover from one single bear market on their lifetimes. When the market fully recovers, your investment in the levered etf is still down HUGE. I demonstrate this clearly with math below: copied my earlier comment. 

No.  It has nothing to do with stomaching volatility. I can see not one actual explanation of why this is a losing bet so I am copying my comment in response to every single comment as a PSA to prevent people from ruining themselves. 

You have to understand something. And I feel like nobody realizes this. 

If your portfolio loses 50 percent one month, and then gains 50 percent the next month, that’s not breakeven. 100 becomes 50, which then becomes 75. You’re still down 25 percent. 

Now multiply that effect by 3. At some point, you will experience a bear market and when the above affect is multiplied by 3, you will lose a magnified amount, and when the underlying recovers fully, you will be nowhere near recovered. Please see why:

Consider that a 30 percent bear market loses you 90%. **If you lose 90%, (a million becomes 100,000), what do you need to get back to a million?  You need 10x returns or 1000% returns**. Think about this:

in order to recover from a 30% negetive run of the underlying (90% loss to you), you need the underlying to go up 333%. (1000% gain to you). But someone who was invested regularly and loses 30%, only needs a 42% positive run to return. So , when the market goes up 42% and fully recovers, as it always does, people invested in the underlying will be back to break even. Meanwhile your 100k remaining goes up 120%  and is now worth… 220k. 

Wait a minute… the market fully recovered, but your 1 million is still down 80%??? Yes. 

Does this explain why it’s not buy and hold? Volatility exponentially magnifies your losses compared to gains of the same amount. And the higher the losses, the more exponentially this effect is magnified. So the “market” always recovers yes, but that does not mean your levered principal does!!!! In fact, if you experience one single recession, you will spend the rest of your life fighting to get back to break even and most likely never will. This is a fact. And this is something that you do NOT see when you look at the “returns” of the levered etf. 

Everyone this is the key: *the market recovering fully will not mean your etf recovers fully! And the bigger the negetive dip is, the more behind market recovery you will be. As stated above, if the underlying goes down 30% , you will need it to go up 300 percent unlevered in order to recover whereas someone invested in the regular underlying will only need it to go up 42% for them to recover.* so, you need 7x returns (300/42) to catch up but the levered etf only gives you 3x… hmmm. 

If you ever experience a bear market, you are done. Especially if you are closer to retirement at that point. How long would it take your to recover from a 30% market dip where you need 300% market bull run to just break even? You’re signing up for this? 

Therefore, the only way this is a winning buy and hold strategy for 40 years is if there is never another bear market ever again. 

People who think levered etfs are a buy and hold strategy don’t understand this magnified , exponential loss due to volatility. They think a market recovery means full recovery for them when in reality a full market recovery leaves them down tewmendously. 

Now imagine experiencing 2 bear markets in your 40 year holding period? Most likely you will. And you will be left with pennies on the dollar regardless of what the “returns” look like on the fact sheet. 

The “market” always recovers but YOUR PRINCIPAL does not. There is a difference.

Now this is the most important point, pay close attention. 

Lastly, say the market went down 32% instead of 30%. Now you lose 96% instead of 90 so your 1 million is now down to 40,000. So in order to recover to a million from that, you would need 25x returns or 2,500% returns, which means you would need over 800% unlevered market positive returns in order for you’re levered position to recover from a 32% dip. 800/32 is 25x. **The loss is 25x more powerful then a gain of the same amount after the fact. 

Do you see how much more magnified this effect is just by adding 2% to the initial downswing I described earlier? (From 30 to 32). A 30% unlevered market loss meant you needed 300% unlevered market returns to recover. But a 32% unlevered market loss means you need 800% unlevered market returns to recover.

You're, historically, dead wrong about this and you need to stop pushing the narrative. UPRO, the x3 SPY ETF has outperformed SPY in any 30 year period, ever. This has been backtested from *before the great depression*.

No your posts are trying to scare people away from something that you barely understand.

I’m personally doing TECL TQQQ NVDL

With 300k

But I know at some point if it crashes hard enough I may be forced to sell because if you lose like 99% of your money it doesn’t just bounce back due to the drag.

There’s large risk holding but I’m doing it, trying to get my 1 million in 2 years then I add kmlm hedge 8-15% that will make it less risky in large down turns.

QLD is a safer option but still gets pretty beat up if a 2000 level crash happens.

So what happens is my 300k could go down to like 6k with a 2000 level crash, but if I have a hard sell at like 100k I would be able to survive things so…

If you did 92% tqqq 8% kmlm you’d cover your ass a little more, but the 8% will slow you down a little.

lmwmyqb,"Well, but you made it seem as if you were going to need the money in a year.

If you have long term goals you can use leverage to increase diversification which would be more optimal long term. I personally would not have a 100% QQQ portfolio. QQQ has done exceptionally well in the last ten years or so, but the last time something happened it had a 80% plus crash. 

According to modern portfolio theory, the right way to use leverage is finding the most optimal portfolio (highest expected returns relative to the risk you’re taking) and then leverage it up. The most optimal portfolio is impossible to find, but the point is that you should hold a broadly diversified portfolio and then increase its risk through leverage. 

If you do that, you’re due to have higher returns for the same risk if you’re investing for the long term.

Different assets perform best under different economic conditions. The last 15 years have been great for stocks so they’ve crushed everything else. There are other regimes when other assets crush stocks. 

In summary, stocks do well during times of economic growth with no inflation shocks. Fixed income do well in times of deflation or economic stagnation with low inflation. Trend following managed futures strategies do best in times of change (like inflation shocks) and are more or less flat during other regimes. Commodities also kind of work during inflation shocks but they’re a drag during every other market condition, so it’s probably better to invest in them through trend following or carry strategies.

Managed futures are strategies that trade future contracts. These are contracts where you agree to sell or buy an asset for a set price in a future date. These contracts can be bought or sold through an exchange and constantly change in price. They’re used for leverage (instead of taking a loan and buying the asset, you agree to buy it in the future which exposes you to the price increase or decrease in said asset without having bought it) and for risk transfer (you can enter a contract hoping to be compensated for taking the risk of a change in the price of the underlying asset).

Managed futures mainly use trend following (time series momentum, in academic language) to take long or short positions in futures.

These strategies are generally uncorrelated to stocks and bonds, though they can all crash together if there’s a liquidity crisis in the market. Trend following needs a trend to develop so it can’t avoid a very sudden crash. However, if there’s a prolonged bear market after the crash, they should thrive through shorting everything that’s doing badly.

Instead of falling into FOMO and recency bias, you can use leverage to create a stocks/bonds/managed futures, which are generally uncorrelated assets. If you’re thinking for the long term and you want to use leverage, that’s a better idea than going all in QQQ. 

Be prepared for your portfolio to behave differently to the S&P 500 and having long periods of underperformance, though. That it should work better long term doesn’t mean that it will do better every year. It will have lower drawdowns, which will let you keep compounding.

You can access managed futures through ETFs like DBMF, KMLM and CTA. You can access return stacked managed futures/stock or bonds leveraged mixes through RSST and RSBT.",1726222728,2,ETFs,1ffjnif,/r/ETFs/comments/1ffjnif/leveraged_etf_strategy_to_protect_downside_risk/lmwmyqb/

m6kapnm,"I’m a noob so take my comment with a pinch of salt. I think that leveraged ETFs are dangerous due to potential volatility in the underlying asset. That being said, a safer strategy could be to invest in bonds where you expect less volatility and safer returns. However, a long term leverage play could be a disaster.   
  
I made this post 9 months ago. Looking at the 1 year return on these leveraged bond ETFs, you can see there's a variety of results. If you picked TMF 12 months ago you would be down by 3x your investment. 

So that might make you think, maybe going short term is a safer play. Like day trading for example. I imagine all good day traders do trade with leverage. But as you said, that's a lot of taxable events. Personally I prefer passive investments. I'm not sure if holding any leveraged ETF is a good idea in the long term. But like I said, I'm a noob so take this comment with a pinch of salt.

hrjvb88,"TQQQ does have risks, which is why a lot of people using it suggest also using a hedge.

It also has risks that are not readily apparent.  The volatility decay has been discussed ad nauseum and is not necessarily a problem as long as QQQ keeps going up, but could be an issue if QQQ trades sideways for an extended period of time.

However, I'd also be concerned about counterparty risk (they use various instruments to generate the 3x returns, but in a crazy market situation there is no guarantee the counterparty will be able to hold up their end, and the fund could face big problems.)  Things like counterparty risk is the difference between using PortfolioVisualizer to theorycraft vs the real world.

hrldsgy,"Consistent with the idea of [Lifecycle Investing](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=274390), young people should use leverage (if they can tolerate the additional risk ofc). So you are on the right track there.

Naysayers will cite [volatility decay](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/exchangetradedfunds/07/leveraged-etf.asp) as the primary reason why letfs are a bad idea long term. [This has been disproven.](http://www.ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php) Volatility decay is a real thing that does hurt returns, let's be clear, but it's effects are exaggerated.

If you want to go for a leveraged strategy, arguably the best way is with [HFEA](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/hedgefundie-adventure/). This will serve you better than TQQQ.

To learn more about leverage I recommend [Optimized Portfolio's article,](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/how-to-beat-the-market/) and r/LETFS.

In general I don't like sector funds (and QQQ is basically a tech sector fund) since they reduce diversification without an improvement in expected returns.  I think people who are attracted to some of these are performance chasing.  That approach has not historically done well; see ARK funds for a recent example.

Deciding to put a significant amount of money on a leveraged sector fund that has had a gangbuster run coupled with PE expansion over the past decade seems like a recipe for disappointment.  But hey, what do I know?  Anything can happen.

gux0itx,"Leveraged ETFs lose money due to volatility, a phenomenon called beta decay, slippage, or volatility decay.

The 3x multiplier of a fund like TQQQ does not apply to the long-term return. Rather, it applies to the _daily_ return, because the leverage resets daily.

For example, let's assume both QQQ and TQQQ start at $100 (the prices don't matter, this is just an example), then this happens:

| Day | QQQ | Change | Total return | TQQQ | Change | Total return |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| 0 | $100 | | 0% | $100 | | 0% |
| 1 | $90 | -10% | -10% | $70 | -30% | -30% |
| 2 | $100 | +11.11% | 0% | $93.33 | +33.33% | -7% |

Even though QQQ completely recovered on day 2, TQQQ did not. In fact, TQQQ would have to rise 42.86% in order to recover, which means that when QQQ drops 10%, it has to rise 14.29% the next day for TQQQ to recover.

If the market _only_ goes up, there's no risk. But that's not what happens in real life.

Over time, leveraged funds like TQQQ and UPRO have had enormous growth, but also enormous drawdowns. It's ultimately a very risky bet that will see extreme drops at various times, but also times of recovery.",1618704287,67,ETFs,mszw3f,/r/ETFs/comments/mszw3f/i_dont_understand_how_leveraged_etfs_can_make_you/gux0itx/

guxxd43,"> if a crash happens, long term always recovers. 

This is the assumption that these funds are not allowed to make, and why individuals repeat the rhetoric of ""it may not be worth the risk."" You have to assume that the long term will always recover and then some since you need more gain to offset losses. Going back to even in the index isn't enough when you apply leverage.

I'm not saying that I think we will see a sustained downtrend anytime soon or even a flat market. I'm bullish on the American market, but not all markets are like this. Look at the Nikkei 225, which is the Japanese market index. It boomed and then peaked, its all-time-high in December 1989. If you had been in that market, your leveraged fund would still be underwater today.

The assumption that in the long term, indexes will always go up (or at least, the indexes you've picked for your leveraged fund) is what fund managers aren't allowed to say because it doesn't apply to all indexes and as a rule, doesn't apply to any index.

We also have to remember that our psychology is different when things heat up than when we just think about them heating up. Looking at a -70% in your account during a crash is much harder to do than to think about, even if you firmly believe that it will eventually go up. There will be the temptation to move out of those funds and cut your losses no matter how steeled we think we are. Not saying you will, but there will always be that thought.

It's easy to forget in seemingly never-ending bull markets that our goal should be minimizing downside risk first, then maximizing upside potential.",1618724775,4,ETFs,mszw3f,/r/ETFs/comments/mszw3f/i_dont_understand_how_leveraged_etfs_can_make_you/guxxd43/

Seems like the shares you hold are a small portion of your portfolio so it’s not that big of a deal anyway. Cheers",1618939352,2,ETFs,mszw3f,/r/ETFs/comments/mszw3f/i_dont_understand_how_leveraged_etfs_can_make_you/gv831pt/

guz9bt0,"That really depends on a lot of factors. The Nikkei 225 peaked at 38,957 on December 29th, 1989. It continually fell for the next 20 years. On March 10th, 2009, it hit bottom at 7,054. That's an 81.9% drop over that timespan.

It had another crash on March 15th, 2011 after the Tohoku earthquake where it dropped to 8,605.

It's been on a rapid recovery since then and has locked in a lot of gains in the last few years in particular. Today, the Nikkei 225 is at 29,683.

If you didn't ever look at the price of the index and just DCA'd every month since the peak, you'd have recovered but it would've taken somewhere between 2015-2018 to do so. That's a ridiculous amount of time and a time that a lot of Japanese investors who threw everything into the top of the bubble didn't have.

The Nikkei 225 and the Japanese stock market are artificially held up by the Bank of Japan. They are a top 10 largest shareholder in 90% of the companies in the Nikkei 225 and they own 75% of Japanese domiciled ETFs.

The BoJ is their Fed and I stand by the ""don't fight the Fed"" mentality, but I can't imagine how fragile our market would be if the Fed had large stakeholdings in almost all of the S&P 500 companies.

For those interested, the best way IMO to invest in the Nikkei 225 is through **$DXJ**. It's hedged against fluctuations in USD/JPY so currency conversions shouldn't hurt you.",1618761048,1,ETFs,mszw3f,/r/ETFs/comments/mszw3f/i_dont_understand_how_leveraged_etfs_can_make_you/guz9bt0/

gv6y3ih,"I am thrilled. I looked briefly last night and it didn't seem like their holdings are the same but it was late. I decided fresh eyes today would be better. I'm gonna go through SSO very carefully including its managers work ethic, history etc. Basically a deep deep dive because I'll tell ya, the two times I sold RYCCX I took a huge hit. Tbh, i didn't want to loo, I just accepted. It came back strong each time due to a bull week but I should have never sold. The amount of RYCCX shares I own now is way less than I did. That's obvious. It's already fully funded for the year but If SSO is the same/close with a  .91 expense ratio maybe a 50/50 move would be warranted. Then if it handles and runs as well say goodbye to my beloved RYCCX and fund SSO in the future. Thanks for the project.

I found RYCCX accidently a few years ago when I became able to manage my own retirement accounts. I had to hold my ground with USAA because they said it was too dangerous. When I moved to Fidelity I also had to tick a lot of boxes saying I understood this is a bad idea. Gave me a belly ache. Not one person irl or online said long term hold was smart.... Yet my portfolio contunued to grow. It's been  2 - 2= 15. 

I started diversified with small cap, mid cap, etc... but noticed RYCCX's growth was soaring and way out performing my other funds. So slowly I moved everything into it until I was 100%. I still have a Roth and inherited IRA that are more um.... balanced. This is strickly in a roll over IRA. To be honest it still blows everything away. I can't remember the exact scenario now but had I kept RYCCX in my Roth in March of 2020 I would have way over $200k instead of now $120k......which to some is scary low, I know for retirement but to others like me... Its a miracle.

guzn6wx,"Professional research says that yes, an all-world fund is the best thing you can do. This is called the [Modern Portfolio Theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp).

Typically, this portfolio is created with 2 or 3 funds that are rebalanced annually or semi-annually.

2-fund portfolio: $VT & $BNDW

3-fund portfolio: $VTI, $VXUS, & $BNDW

The difference is the investor's ability to control the US vs International weightings, though if we really believe in MPT then $VT, which is held at market-weight, is preferable. This is because, as you noted, we want to shift away from biased investor behavior and approach portfolio construction from a rule-based, methodical approach. Market-weighting seems to be the best bet as companies are held at their natural weights and not at weights chosen by an investor, which you could do with the individual geo-located ETFs. You will very often see folks in r/portfolios who overweight the US market using exactly this method with the 3-fund portfolio. They may be right (I think they are), but that is speculation.

Jack Bogle's (founder of Vanguard) advice for bond allocation was your equity % should be 120 less your age. If you're 30, then your equity would be 90% and your bond allocation would be 10%. Scale until you retire, where he says go 50/50. This allows retirees to sell equities during bull markets and sell bonds during bear markets so that they can fund their retirement spending without having to sell during downturns.

So if you're 30, the best portfolio according to MPT is 90% $Vt, 10% $BNDW. Done. No more complications -- it's just not necessary. If you've seen Vanguard's ""target-date funds,"" this is basically what they do with their allocations, only they are a little more conservative with bonds.

Of course, investors are often unhappy with this, especially active investors because of the reduced upside potential (read as: diversification). Warren Buffet famously said, ""Diversification is a shield for ignorance."" It's done to reduce downside risk at the cost of upside potential. Putting all of your eggs in one basket, especially a high beta meme stock (you know the one I'm talking about) can be make or break. This is a gamble, but many people will argue that the gamble is good if it paid off and that they are just unlucky if it doesn't. Diversification really does hurt your upside, but we must accept that if we want a reasonable shield for our ignorance of the unknown future.

Our goal as investors is to assess gambles before we know the outcomes, not after. It's easy to be validated for making good gambles and it's easy to call yourself unlucky and avoid criticism for an uninformed, bad gamble if you're wrong. This all-world portfolio is designed to avoid those gambles entirely.

Disclaimer, my portfolio is not this at all, but I also am an active investor who manages my portfolio daily and you can see my comment history where I talk about a lot of the positions I've taken. I am not the norm and I don't want to give advice to people who want to set something and let it run without management. For those people, MPT really is the best bet.

guzsnh8,"First of all, thank you very much for taking the time to reply so thoroughly. As you can probably guess, I am still very much a beginner in the world of investing, but I am basically soaking up as much information as I can. Therefore, such a detailed response is very much appreciated. 

When I fist started to read about stocks I was leaning more towards buying individual stocks with a healthy drip plan, but the more I read, the more I realise that I am not yet at a point where my investment would be anything else but a gamble. That is when I started to look into ETFs and as far as I can tell, they are a very good starting point for an investor. 

I also have to consider that I am from Austria and our tax laws make it very difficult to move capital gain around without incuring heavy taxation, which would just be very inefficient. That is why I am more focused on investing a big chunk of my money into a well-diversivied ETF portfolio. 

Right now I am leaning mostly towards either going with Vanguard or Blackrock (they are quite dominant here in Europe) and just start out with an all-world ETF. From there I feel like allocating a smaller amount into Bonds and another portion into a specific market or sector that I believe in. 

I do however want to learn more about valuating stocks in order to have a smaller percentage of my money ride on ""bets"" I take with stocks I believe in. 

I read a lot about picking the right ETFs and the opinions obviously differ, but how relevant would you say are capital gains, dividends received, and the difference between distribution/accumulating ETFs compared to the management fees, which a lot of people claim is the main thing one should focus on (i.e. always pick the cheapest one).

gcql05g,"You should Google this question. But I will give you the breakdown.

Leveraged funds do really well with low volatility. They are able to use the low volatility atmosphere to build funds over time. Also… Leveraged funds do really well in a bull run. We are in the midst of a bull run, so that back testing will show huge out performance.  

Leveraged funds typically grow a little over two times in a perfect scenario, but can drop at three or more times the rate of their fund. This is known as Beta case decay, And it is partially a function of the daily rebalancing and partially a function of needing to sell shares at a loss during a downturn.

You can use leveraged funds longterm if you think these conditions will be profitable. Also, you can do cash secured puts or covered calls.  Many strategies on this at WSB.

 A word of caution: TMF will likely not return the same as a backtest in the future.  It’s complicated, but the TLDR is that fed rates are 0% and will be for a while (but not forever).",1605720886,18,ETFs,jwjhs0,/r/ETFs/comments/jwjhs0/seriously_why_not_hold_leveraged_etfs_long_term/gcql05g/

gcrbdru,"The reason leveraged funds are extremely risky is a mathematical principle called beta decay, or bta slippage. Since a leveraged fund resets daily (note that there are some that reset differently, e.g. monthly), they only capture the relative percentage increase or decrease for that day.

As shown [here](https://seekingalpha.com/article/1864191-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-decay-of-leveraged-etfs), if an index goes up 25% on day and down 20% the next (meaning net zero gain over two days), then any 2x bull ETF against that index will be down 10% the following day.

hl7tjnf,"Here's what I've learned since going very very hard in the paint on RYVYX, TQQQ, TECL, QLD & SOXL from April 2020...

Most of the responses below are from people who simply Google'd ""leveraged ETFs,"" found the first few articles that all spouted doom and gloom for long holders, and then copied/pasted their findings into threads like these. Few have ever experienced the opportunity have bought at the bottom of what we experienced in early 2020.  Let alone to have bought leveraged funds.

“Success occurs when opportunity meets preparation.”

You've probably seen it written 100 times over the past two years: 2020 was the greatest buying opportunity we've seen in the last decade, maybe ever.

I chickened out on shorting the Covid crash so I waited for a little bit of confirmation on the recovery and went after some leveraged ETFs and RYVYX, which is a leveraged mutual fund.  More on RYVYX below.  I'm very happy with my 100%-300%+ realized and unrealized overall ROI on multiple buy-ins across all of the funds mentioned. So obviously the question now is when to jump out. Should we ever?

""BEWARE LEVERAGED FUNDS"" is all I read and I understand why. I get how they work and the risks involved. So when the market becomes flat again, is probably the time to pull, but with the NASDAQ rolling on, all I can do is wait for the next correction and pull some or all out, but for now I can't bring myself to do it. The ""safe"" part of my brain that gravitated toward funds, albeit leveraged funds, clashed with the other side of my brain telling me to throw every dollar I had at TSLA.  TSLA would have actually yielded a better return from April 2020 to now as compared to even TQQQ. But you wouldn't see as many people trying to speak caution toward a TSLA play as they would toward these leveraged funds. If you ask me, TSLA is way more risky. (I await the hate mail.)

If you run the past performance ROI calculators on these funds (like you have), especially on RYVYX, compare it to QQQ or even FXAIX and even if you take into account the expense ratio (how much you'll pay in fees over the course of time), you're way out in front as long as they these funds don't randomly dissolve/liquidate along the way for whatever reason outside of a very bad, multi-week correction down. I don't care how much I have to pay in expenses if the end result is an overall profit that is much higher than a non-leveraged ETF/mutual fund.

QLD survived 2008 crash, 2018 dip, and 2020 dip

TQQQ / TECL / SOXL survived 2018 dip and 2020 dip

**RYVYX survived DOT COM crash, 2008 crash, 2018 dip and 2020 dip, and is 20+ years old.  The same can't even be said for MANY of the tech stocks in the wake of the DOT COM crash.**

That's on top of *all* the other Leveraged funds that survived the same dips and crashes. That being said, mine are all tied to tech growth and specifically tracking QQQ. Could another DOT COM happen? I guess anything is possible.

[This page](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/082515/why-leveraged-etfs-are-not-longterm-bet.asp) explains why.

But the gist of it is that daily leverage resetting  ~~can~~ *will* kill you:

>	Typically, you will find that **the more volatile the benchmark (the S&P 500 in this example) for a leveraged ETF, the more value the ETF will lose over time, even if the benchmark ends up flat or had a 0% return at the end of the year. If the benchmark moved up and down drastically along the way, you may end up losing a significant percentage of the value of the ETF** if you bought and held it. 


You’re young and have an appetite for risk, and that’s great. But leveraged ETFs will give you multiple times the risk for shit reward.

Even in the best-case scenario, daily leverage resetting will eat huge chunks of your gains.

And no, a leveraged bond fund is not a good hedge.

If you actually want gains from taking on more risk, use real leverage — borrow money on margin or from somewhere else and invest it in un-leveraged ETFs or individual stocks.

Hell, even without leverage, ARKK or ARKG will give you far better gains than leveraged ETFs, with far less risk.

If you understand what you're doing and have a high risk tolerance and time, then it may make sense to go all in. If you're starting in a small account, it may make even more sense. 

Again, as long as you understand what you're doing and the tax implications that follow, it's all up to you. Understanding what you're doing does not mean you will guarantee a gain or can say where we will be next year, only that you understand the risk you are taking. This is the case with a leveraged ETF just as it is the case with a non leveraged product.

Everything about investing depends on the choices we are comfortable making and some chance involved between the start and end of our investing cycle. Losses compound just as gains compound, depending your cycle and choices, you may have outsized losses, or outsized gains.

As I think the Rusdia situation dies down it is clear to me that countries have just entered into a new arms race. This also gives the excuse for central banks to keep on printing. A win win for the NWO. So I have a strong belief that Defense Contractors will soar in this environment. I myself have a strong risk tolerance. So I want to capitalize on this to get the best returns possible. Dealing with straight up buying options imo is more riskier than buying DFEN (3X Defense Contractor ETF). So if I just want to buy something and not worry about strike prices and expiration dates but at the same time take on bigger exposure (and yes bigger risk) to the Defense Contractors space would be to just buy a 3x Leveraged ETF. I already do this and successfully thus far with crude oil. Been buying UCO (2X leverage to oil) for quite a while. Both ETFs have similar expense ratios. And UCO needs an advil because it's been carrying the rest of my portfolio as it has performed so well. Even in pull backs, as it eventually goes higher it reaches higher highs. So I already know I will be buying DFEN lol. Just wanted to share my experience with UCO. And see if anybody else has experiences with success on longer term investments through leveraged ETFs because sooo many people are strongly against it for longer term holds.

kraqmv7,"Buying and holding a 3x leveraged ETF isn’t a sound strategy. It’s basically a gamble on a bull market with relatively low volatility. It can pay off big, but it can also go to zero. If you invested in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 your investment would have went to zero (that’s with a rough TQQQ simulation which underestimates ER and leverage costs). Only if you started in 2003 and 2004 would you have survived, assuming you could have held on through a 95% drawdown which I doubt. From 2009 to current there has been a relatively strong market. If that continues, it could pay off. If not you’ll go to zero. In my opinion you need some type of diversification (treasuries, managed futures, etc) or some type of trend following to increase your chances of surviving down markets.

If you simulate it during 2000 you’ll notice it drops 99.7% or something insane like that. Is the tech market worth as much as now as it was in 2000? Yes it’s worth way more, but TQQQ has not yet recovered because it would need many thousands of percent return to recover. TQQQ has leverage messing with it but you can look at QQQ the same.

It is A LOT HARDER for an economy 10% the size of the old one to produce the remaining 90% missing than it was for the old one to lose the value. Losing value is easy. Gaining value is hard.

If two days later or a year later, the price is $100/shares, you still have 10 shares and they are still worth $1000.

I can't wrap my head around your example/explanation, but it seems you suggest that when a leverage ETF drops in price, you lose shares, which of course is not true.",1617904768,20,ETFs,mmvexy,/r/ETFs/comments/mmvexy/can_someone_explain_to_me_why_tqqq_is_a_bad_long/gtu4skv/
gu19vws,"You did the math wrong. 

Leveraged ETF’s are reset daily, and your stock holdings will reflect the price/share after each daily reset.

Let’s say you buy $1000 of ETF-2x at $100 a share. 

Let’s assume ETF-X dropped by 5% at the end of the day. Theoretically, ETF-2X should drop 10%, bringing your shares down to $90/Share. Your portfolio balance is now $900. 

Daily Reset. Day 2.

The ETF-X moves up 5% at the end of the day, resulting in a -0.25% loss over two days. 

ETF-2X theoretically moves up 10%, which brings your $90/Share at the start of the day, to $99/Share for a portfolio total of $990. After two days, your portfolio net worth has dropped $10. 

Even though the ETF-X stock had a net decrease of -0.25% over two days, owning ETF-2X over those same two days resulted in you losing -1%, which is 4x the loss of ETF-X. 

Therefore, if your leveraged ETF is seeing consistent daily losses, you’re bleeding money. If the fund that your Leverage ETF is tracking does not bounce back, you bleed even more. 

Holding a leveraged ETF is great if you’re expecting a Bull market for a while, but if you own a leveraged ETF during a Bear Market, you’re gonna have a bad time.

*Owning a 2x, 3x, 4x leveraged ETF does not mean a 2x, 3x, 4x risk.*

If you try to time your sale, you’ll very likely either sell prematurely (not the worst thing in the world if you’ve made satisfactory return during your holding period), or not sell quick enough, and be stuck in the trough.

With these leveraged ETFs, it’s much better to set goals and quit while you’re ahead rather than be greedy and attempt to ride it out for maximum gains by selling at the opportune moment. (The exception is if your timeframe is longer than market cycles and you’re good with waiting it out 10-15+ years. Especially if you think that the price you’re buying at is lower than the price will be at the forthcoming corrections/crashes. Even then, owning these leveraged ETFs at the time of crash is never ideal and IMO should be avoided at all costs.)

This is my opinion, and I don’t know shit about investing. All I can say is milk the leveraged ETFs while you’re confident that the market will go up, exit while you’re ahead, and don’t be greedy or emotional.

As you said, these are obvious mathematical facts. I can see how volatility can certainly eat at returns for certain leveraged ETFs (I’m in SOXL lol).

hfrq5u3,"Most explanations of leveraged ETFs like TQQQ are unsatisfactory.  Let me attempt to clarify this.

TQQQ seeks a return that is 3x the return of QQQ for a single day.  What does this actually means?  In a nutshell, it means that they use many financial instruments to faithfully amplify the return of QQQ in a single day.

Leverage is like borrowing money. Imagine that instead of spending $100 to buy  QQQ, you borrow your dad $200, and spend the $300 on QQQ.   If QQQ goes up 1%, your total investment becomes $303.  After you pay your dad $200, you have $103 left, you earn 3%.  That's 3x leverage.   Similarly, if QQQ goes down 1%, you'll lose roughly 3%.

That's leverage.

Now, this leverage is reset daily.  What does that mean?  It means you have to pay back $200 to your dad everyday.  What does this mean then?  It means that if you end up with $105 the next day, you will borrow $210 to leverage.  If you end up with only $90 the next day, then you will only borrow $180 to leverage.

This has many implications. But that is about all there is to it.

\*\*\*

A lot of folks get lost in the math and misunderstand TQQQ.

So, should you invest in TQQQ?  By investing, we are talking about long term.

To answer this question, there are a few things to consider:

(1) What is the quality of the underlying index, QQQ?

This question important because leveraging is borrowing money to make a bet.  The more money you borrow to make a bet, the larger the bet is.   Leveraging is no difference from borrow money from the bank to do business.  Should you borrow $20,000 from a bank to put in a business?  It depends how good the underlying business is.

The underlying index, QQQ, is US non-financial largest caps.  Tech is a huge chunk of QQQ because it is cap weighted.

If you believe in this index, if you believe in QQQ, then investing in TQQQ sounds like a good idea.

But here comes the 2nd question.

&#x200B;

(2) How faithful can TQQQ mimic 3x of QQQ?

The goal of TQQQ is not to make money. Its goal  is to mimic QQQ, or 3x of QQQ, to be precise.

This is a very important thing to know.  The managers try their best to get 3x of QQQ, daily.

Let compare this discipline to the hypothetical  leverage example above. Let's suppose that after borrowing $200 from you dad and paying him back at the end of the day.   Now you have $103.  So the next day, you think you're smart, you feel invincible, so instead of borrow $206, you want to borrow $250.   If that's what you do, you deviate from the 3x leverage goal.  You time the market. And that can completely mess up the long term investment goal.

So. TQQQ's goal is not to make money. No. Its goal is to mimic QQQ as faithfully as possible.  Why is this a good idea?  It is because it reduces one dimension of concerns for you.   When you make a bet, you are really betting on QQQ.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*

Now, you put (1) and (2) together:  If you believe strongly in QQQ, and the TQQQ managers can mimic 3x of TQQQ daily, then TQQQ sounds like to a pretty good investment long term.

hfqu52m,"Let’s say QQQ goes down 20% on day 1 and then up 25% on day 2.

So QQQ is now back where it started, since (1 - 20 / 100) * (1 + 25/100) = 1.

However, TQQQ is in a much worse place than when it started, since (1 - 3 * 20 / 100) * (1 + 3 * 25/100) = 0.7.

So if QQQ is making wild swings back and forth and landing roughly on its original value, TQQQ will be losing money.

The last decade has been unbelievably good for QQQ, since it invests primarily in large-cap US growth stocks and this decade has been perhaps the best decade ever for such investments. And because there hasn’t been much volatility over the past decade in the US market (a brief period in 2020 excluded), leveraged US stock ETFs have also done unbelievably well.

The first factor was the dramatic outperformance of US large-cap growth stocks.

The second was the relatively smooth path this outperformance took. 

Both of these factors are very unusual historically. In the past, the riskier non-US, small-cap, and value stocks have all generated slightly higher returns as compensation for their higher levels of risk. This makes the past decade an anomaly in stock market history.

And the fact that for the most part, the past decade was smooth sailing for investors is also pretty unusual. There were relatively few days with dramatic drops, which is what really harms leveraged ETFs in the long term.

Basically, you're going to do somewhat worse than the nominal leverage of the fund if you hold it long term. 

One other issue is tax efficiency. Some of the funds (including Proshares funds) distributes gains from the derivatives they hold as a dividend. If the fund is held in a taxable account, these will be taxed as income, which is usually a higher tax rate than long-term capital gains.

More generally, you're giving yourself a lot of exposure to markets for short-term derivatives.

The strategy is combining UPRO with a similarly 3x leveraged long term bond fund, TMF. I do 60/40 upro/tmf. 

This strategy is actually shown to beat 100% upro on some time horizons. (When market is nothing but up, say 2010-2018, then 100% upro will beat almost anything) However, over longer time horizons, HEFA beats upro. This is because of parity and what my dumbass calls ""gains harvesting"". Because you rebalance quarterly, if UPRO is going gangbusters, when you rebalance, you shift some cash into TFM, therefore it will go down less when upro eventually dips. This also ensures you have a larger portfolio to grow on the upswing. Think of a growing snowball rolling down a hill. You could do 100% upro, it will grow fast, but you are starting with a significantly decreased portfolio. HEFA may roll a little slower downhill, but the portfolio didn't take as massive of a hit so you have more to work with coming off a bad period.

>The point of a backtest is to compare past performance, and picking different timeframes is good for that. Its as arbitrary as using one of the longest sustained bull runs in history like OP has.  **Other time-frames are more informative.**

Yes, which is why I found it curious you used what is, by your own admission, a timeframe that isn't all that informative. (And apparently one that isn't actually shown in the link you provided?)

Using the bottom of the market without mentioning it is inherently deceptive. 22 years is a **weird** timeframe to use. (And by your own admission not the most useful...)",1634514602,0,ETFs,qa328s,/r/ETFs/comments/qa328s/someone_please_explain_why_100_upro_is_a_bad_idea/hh1q9tb/

I found an article, found a time frame, noticed it jumped and dropped to the exact same amount over a 22 year time frame, and brought it up as a counterpoint because any strategy that does that over a long term and is ultimately bested by the market it is trying to 3x may not be the best long term strategy.

j4x334r,"Don‘t call it wrong or right, call it suited for a certain scenario and financing situation or not.

Why do you want leveraged ETFs? Normally, to bump exposure up without binding capital (i.e. avoid margin loan). So it‘s a way of financing, ultimately. You gain 3x expo, you save the margin/credit/etc., but you pay basically with two things, maybe three:
(1) higher TER: caused by the synthetic stuff… TER I think 1.8% for TQQQ or so vs. otherwise 0.1% or so on QQQ;
(2) volatility decay. simple to model: simulate a volatile sideways period, e.g. 20 times in a row compare a -2%, then immediately a +2% move in QQQ; do that for TQQQ where then it’s -6%, +6%, respectively. Compare the two, you will see TQQQ drops like a stone, QQQ much less in such a sideways market.
(3) maybe you could add the risk of TQQQ being all futures and leveraged, so counterparty risk is higher in case of a melt-down a la 2007/08 since in such an event paper-products might fail vs. an ETF owning shares. However, to eliminate that you need to dig deep into contracts of ETF to see if you actually own more than paper anyway.

So in short: TQQQ depending on market environment is a more economic or less economic way of financing. Down, volatile, sideways -> leveraged bites you (but also margin loan is dangerous in that case); up -> leveraged ETF is probably an economic way to pay for higher exposure, depending what you would alternatively pay for margin.

* no expert, and of course no financial advise; also, I do hold UPRO and TQQQ as a way to bump exposure.",1674077755,9,ETFs,10fgskh,/r/ETFs/comments/10fgskh/holding_tqqq_long_term/j4x334r/

j4x6m08,"The biggest risk, IMO, is that people won't be able to handle the stomach-churning downturns during bear markets/crashes.  People panic enough at 20-30% down.  How would they fare at 60-90% down, and the prospect of years to recover if ever?

Nobody truly knows how they will handle downturns until they've actually lived through one, and handling a downturn triple-leveraged is way beyond that.  Would you be able to hold waiting for a recovery while watching your $500K TQQQ portfolio fall to $100K?  Or would you panic when it's fairly low to put it in something safer while you still had something left?

Anyway, aside from that are things you may have heard before like volatility decay if the market trades sideways so you'll keep losing more and more even if QQQ stays fairly even over time.  Also counterparty risk meaning that the instruments they use to get their triple leverage could have the counterparty fail in some kind of unusual/extreme condition, meaning that the fund itself might fail.

j51iuwc,"Sure! It's true for all assets. The difference is that TQQQ amplifies the effect.

Very simple illustration for the above mentioned -5%, +5% for two days return (sideways). This leads to:

\- QQQ: initial value say 300 --> PNL=300\*95%\*105%=299.25, so you lose 0.75.

\- TQQQ: you will do 100 (because that then gives you exposure of 300) --> PNL=100\*85%\*115%=97.75, so you lose 2.25.

So same initial one-day exposure to Nasdaq, QQQ leveraged with margin, TQQQ no margin but leveraged in the ETF itself.

It's easy to simulate further out (simple or fancy, depending how well you are in excel/python, etc.). If you do it with -2%, +2%, which is more realistic, you'll barely notice something short-term, but over 1 year your loss more than doubles of the TQQQ with 100 vs. QQQ with 300 initial value.

hunzgmp,"I’ve set to 60% VOO, 40% SSO (2x daily S&P 500) in my Roth IRA. I repositioned into this after VOO had come down from $440 to $420, with an eye toward buying into the decline on each pay day. 

Here are my thoughts: 

You really need to be disciplined to use leveraged ETFs and come out well. Parts of this are considering worst case scenarios up front, being honest about what you’re prepared to hold through, being honest about how *long* you’re prepared to be underwater, and having a stated strategy to adhere to. This is critical even when hedging, because hedge strategies can break periodically. 

For example, I looked at HFEA and determined that I’m not comfortable with 3x leverage when bonds may not reliably hedge. However, I am comfortable being full stocks and holding 2x leverage. I looked at back tests, with a specific eye toward underwater periods, and understood that I could underperform the index for well over a year (possibly multiple years). I committed to continuing to make installments on pay days (not pulling forward or holding back), and to be at peace with the outcomes. 

Absent those prior commitments and understandings, your experience during a correction looks a bit like this: 

“BABE! THE MARKET IS DOWN AGAIN!!! THIS IS IT! IT’S THE BIG ONE! WE’RE MOVING IN WITH YOUR UNCLE IN ALASKA AND LIVING OFF THE LAND! $#!+ IS HITTING THE FAN RIGHT NOW!!! DO YOU HEAR ME?! THERE IS NO RETIREMENT! THERE IS NO SECURITY! GRAB THE CAT, I’LL GET THE KIDS! PACK LIGHT, WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE!!!” 

… and that’s basically just a typical, VOO down 1% kind of a day about two weeks into a pull back.

kb38zd8,"Finally guys I did a lot of reasearch and my conclusion is to stay far away of X3 leverage ETF like TQQQ or SOXL or UPRO.

There is some worse scenarios for those X3 leveraged ETF : that's when you buy at ATH and there is a krack or bear market following : dotcom bubble, october 31 2007, august 30 2018, february 19 2020, november 22 2021 (one of the worst recent bear market).
With leverage X3 like TQQQ or SOXL you re done (game over).

My research are telling me :


It is better to chose a daily QQQ×2 or a daily semiconductors×2 the benefit-risk ratio is the best.
S&P500X2 like SSO ETF sucks , it is better to go longe SMH (X1 no leverage).

The minimal annual growth necessary (CAGR) is around 11% for leverage X3.
For leverage X2 the minimal CAGR goes around 8% .
For the krack of dotcom /october 2007 / august 2018 / february 2020  : USD ETF and QLD ETF will outperformed a lot QQQ and SMH.

For the big krack of 2021 I dont have enough time data we need wait few years again. Nowadays SMH will be +5% / QQQ-2% / USD -14% / QLD -23% / TQQQ -48% / SOXL -64%.

So my strategy will be put 10 to 20% of my portfolio to USD or QLD and hold it long  ( I have a preference in USD when I see the data during krack), when the PE ratio of those fucking semiconductors will go down .
For avoid ATH I only look one thing PE ratio (I tried so many stupid and useless tools in the past).
Is it a  bad strategy?

>The failure of investors to understand the negative consequences of volatility on return can lead to unpleasant surprises. A good example of this phenomenon is the experience of many investors who buy leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs). **Typically, investors who buy a leveraged (2×) ETF expect to earn twice the amount as in the corresponding unleveraged ETF if the market advances. Over any extended period of time, however, they typically find the return is less than twice the amount if the market advances and the loss more than twice the amount if the market declines.** Analogous comments would apply to leveraged short ETFs3—that is, the gains on market declines will tend to be less than twice the market decline and the losses on price advances will tend to be more than twice the price rise.

TQQQ is so tempting when you look at CY2017, which was an outlier of low-volatility and raging bull market.

But here's some critically important perspective... 3x leveraged ETFs do NOT follow their parent ETF at a perfect 3x multiplier for the year. They follow each DAY at a 3x multiplier.

Let's say you start with $100 in both QQQ and TQQQ. Today QQQ goes down 20%, and TQQQ goes down 60%. And then tomorrow QQQ goes back up 20%, and TQQQ goes up 60%.

QQQ ended up at $96 (down 4% from starting amount), while TQQQ ended up at $64 (down 36% from starting amount!!).

Because TQQQ tracks its 3x multiplier on a DAILY basis, it really isn't sustainable as a long-term buy-and-hold investment. It's really an instrument meant to be used/abused on a day-to-day trading basis.

My worry is confirmed by the fact that every single successfull leveraged ETF had an inception date.... around 2009... convenient that we can't see how they would have done during 2008 crash.

gnpn3c0,"The biggest arguments are 
1) it won't provide you the stated 2x or 3x long term
my answer to that is that it is remarkably close to it's multiplier long term AND that as an unsophisticated investor, I don't need it to be precisely 2x or 3x, as long as it multiplies results somewhat, it's doing what it needs to do.

2) the decay argument. if the underlying loses 10% and the 3x loses 30%, then an increase of 10% in the underlying won't make you whole. you'd need a gain of 14% in the underlying. 

but the math works the same for a regular un-leveraged ETF. If you lose 10% one day, the next day you'd have to gain more than 10% to break even. The difference is that you'd need to only get an 11% bump the next day, not 14%. But that's the leverage you sign up for. The effect is just multiplied.

3) There is another argument I've heard against leveraged ETFs though. If it goes down fast enough, the fund could just be dissolved and you'd never be able to recoup those losses. That seems like an unfair scenario. When buying shares I expect that I'm able to stay in those shares long enough to become profitable.

gtllo9k,"NO NO NO NO please sir, research and fully understand a security before investing! A leveraged ETF can cause something called capital decay/capital depreciation. You get the 2x or 3x on the upturn, but you also get it in the dips. The problem with getting 2x or 3x the dip is that it takes more to get back where you were. Let’s say that you have 1000$ invested in a leveraged ETF: the index drops 10%, your ETF drops 30%. Your investment is worth 700$ now, the index is worth 900. Then the index hypothetically goes back up 10%. That percentage causes the index to hit 990$, the 3x leveraged ETF hits 770$. The longer you’re in on a leveraged ETF, the more significant your losses will be when the index dips. I hope I explained that clearly enough. Not to mention that leveraged ETFs were formed specifically with day traders/swing traders in mind. I have yet to find a leveraged ETF that isn’t rebalanced every day in order to maintain the 2x or 3x. Unfortunately, even if there are never any dips that cause significant capital decay, this constant rebalancing means that you won’t necessarily have the 2x or 3x to your investment in the longterm. Also, regular ETFs generally invest in some sort of security such as stocks or bonds. Leveraged ETFs are leveraged, which is why they are called that. Leveraging is the borrowing of capital expecting profits on that borrowed capital to be greater. Essentially, instead of investing in a basket of securities like normal ETFs, you are investing in a basket of debts hoping that the debts pay off to the 2x or 3x return. It’s a complicated topic but I hope I explained that well enough for you. A youtuber brought up leveraged ETFs in a video without talking about risks and I naively hopped on the hype train and bought into a 3x leveraged energy ETF at 200$ (I think it was called GUSH) and proceeded to lose a good portion of it, had like 170$ left and was super glad that I was bored and watching how all my stocks/ETFs were performing. If you are willing to do the research/technical analysis of some of the underlying index ETFs like QQQ and SOXX, and chose your buy and sell points before you bought in, then leveraged ETFs could get you some gains, but I don’t recommend them at all for long term.

I bought these during the tech correction last month, when tech stocks were oversold to capitalize on the rebound.

I saw semiconducters were way to heavily discounted, manufacturing shortage is only temporary, and 5g and global EVs means even greater demand for semiconducters. I plan on selling in 2022. I'll probably sell TQQQ sooner. but I see a lot of growth with semiconducters happening.

Even with x3 SPY this has never happened. Even if you could have bought UPRO (x3 SPY) at the peak in 2007 you would be crushing it right now. 

> The market recovering does not mean the levered etf recovers.

No one says this. It is pretty well known that they take longer to recover... that's part of having leverage. 

> It can take decades longer for the levered version to recover depending on how big the dip was.

Except it doesn't. It takes slightly longer than the underlying index. 

> And of course none of them have a performance stream that go back pre 2008

It's really damn easy to simulate x3 daily returns on SPY and factor in the expense ratio. 

> it doesn’t take into account that losing 90% of 100 dollars, and then gaining 90% of remaining 10 dollars , does not get you anywhere close back to even.

It's almost like we measure returns in annual percentages and not in breakeven points. UPRO would have fallen nearly 90% in 2008, guess where it's at now? I'll give you a hint. It's been averaging 33% annualized returns since then and has surpassed SPY by a long shot. 

Since 1993 the optimal amount of leverage to have is 2.37x. This is based on the Kelly Criterion. Here's some fun reading for you to do since I know this is like the fourth time I've had to explain how these things work to you and you always just stop replying once you're shown to be wrong.

hf3fbkk,"But you haven’t explained anything And again, You’re 100% wrong. 

Do you understand the difference between money weighted and time weighted returns? Breakeven point is of course irrelevant but I use it as an example to illustrate the concept: that even though your simulated returns show an overall positive cumulative performance , an actual account with money invested will still be down tremendously. You have proven by saying you “simulated 3x spy returns” that you still are not accounting for the primary risk associated with these etfs. A risk that is 100% known to the entire industry and ignored entirely by your post. 

The spy returns you are looking at are time weighted but your portfolio performance ultimately needs to be money weighted because earning 100% when you only have 100 dollars left is not the same as earning 100% when you have 1000 dollars. This is why increased volatility is terrible for leveraged etfs. These are All simple facts of academic consensus, not my opinion.    Stop me if anything I’ve said is incorrect and tell me why. 

So, You can simulate 3x spy returns (please send your link to you “simulation” ) but that doesn’t tell you how your portfolio would fare in that situation. This is the primary factor that you’re not accounting for. 

The math I presented is simple and true. The fact I use breakeven point as an example is irrelevant; it’s meant to illustrate the above concept. But you’ve latched onto “breakeven” as if that has any meaning and said “we don’t measure performance in breakeven points ”. So you’ve evaded the entire concept that makes you wrong and latched onto a totally inconsequential randomly chosen example. 

You honestly come off as having no idea what you’re talking about, and you’re failing to understand pretty basic concepts of beta capture and volatility. All the while desperately trying to convince strangers to make poor financial choices. 

Anyway; I can rest assured that I’m right and you’re wrong, because thankfully there’s plenty of academic research out there that confirms what I’m saying. 

3x geared etfs as a long term bet  are mathematically proven as bad investments with risk adjusted returns that are multiple notches below market and extremely negetive skew and huge tail risk. All facts. Tell me which one is wrong. 

, if you studied it like you claim to, you would know that. And you would actually counter a single thing I said above. Not vague nothings like “we don’t measure performance in breakeven “ or “I simulated spy returns times 3”. Actually counter the concepts I have illustrated and explain where I erred. 

So even though you can’t understand why you are wrong, rest assured that you are.  

I would suggest that you look up the difference between time weighted and money weighted return. I would also suggest you stop giving awful financial advice to strangers on the internet.

Lastly, on optimal amount of leverage being 2.37; that’s not the same as a daily settlement etf with beta decay. That’s from borrowing money at actual interest rates to invest and then paying back after the horizon, and profiting if you earn a higher return than the interest rates. 

By all means if you can do that, go ahead. This isn’t a discussion about margin. It is about leveraged etfs in particular; so the fact that you’ve provided this link is again a perfect example of you not really knowing what you’re talking about.",1633180737,0,ETFs,pym4dv,/r/ETFs/comments/pym4dv/question_about_leveraged_etfs/hf3fbkk/

fkdazs5,"Basically, leveraged ETFs are strictly for short term day trading. It's a mathematical certainty that overtime you will lose money because of some math shit I don't understand, but you can Google it. Unless there's a strong general trend. Simply put, normally buying a stock while it's cheap and holding is a viable strategy. If you plan on holding for a long time in a bear market, like right now, waiting for coronavirus to pass, by the time it passes, your shares will have decayed significantly.

fkpjys0,"Leveraged ETFs can be held for months or even longer. There IS ""leveraged etf decay"", yes, but it's not as bad as some people think.

Let's compare VOO (Vanguard's S&P 500) & SPUU (Direxion Daily 2x S&P 500).

Let's take a bad period with a big drop: Oct 1 2018 to Apr 23 2019. During this period S&P 500 dropped about \~20% and recovered to the same level. So, VOO went from 268 to 215 and back to 268.

Let's look at its 2x brother, SPUU:

SPUU went from \~57 to \~37 and by Apr 23 2019 recovered to \~56. So it lost \~2% comparing to its non-leveraged brother.

This 2% is ""leveraged etf decay"". Decay will be higher for 3x ETFs and can be higher than my 2% example. For example if we take QQQ & TQQQ for the similar period, TQQQ lost about 11% comparing to QQQ, which fully recovered by Apr 16 2019.

So yes, there is ""leveraged etf decay"" and it can be 2% or it can be 11% or even more, but does it mean we shouldn't use leveraged etfs because of that decay, considering leveraged ETFs can give huge returns (much-much higher than decay) during good times?

hi3e8em,"Honestly, I have seen a lot of ""not good for long term"" type of comments here on leveraged ETF-s and while it makes sense, I would say that TQQQ as part of your portfolio makes total sense. even long term from my point of view. Essentially a leveraged ETF is what the name says - allows you to get more exposure with your money. It comes both ways - up and down, but if you are young(ish), have a long-term horizon, do not like to trade on margin (which comes with its own costs and risks how else you would get leverage otherwise?),then it can be part of your long term view. 

I would put something like 10% of your portfolio in leveraged products and maybe start with QLD (2x) instead of TQQQ (3x) or have a mix of both. I like those the best - gives you a bit broader exposure (yes, yes I know that QQQ in general is highly geared to tech giants) than very specific sector based funds. Let it sit and let it run. 

For example, I made a mistake and got out of my TQQQ exposure after making 30% in 3 months and then gave up and finally bought back in a month ago with 1/3 of initial value at 30% higher price still. I just can not replicate the performance of TQQQ with anything else I have and I want to extend my assets a bit more than just buying into simple VTI/VXUS/QQQ mix.

hi3j0se,"TQQQ is wonderful during bull (up) markets. It will be horrible in down (bear) markets. Generally markets go up. Over the long term they certainly do. If your initial entry point can be when TQQQ is down a bit, then all the better. Right now TQQQ is flirting with $150 again. It's been as low as $56 a year ago, and as high as $152. A year from now it could be <50 or it could be >325. No one knows with certainty. Since no one knows what the future holds for the market, no one can tell you the best time to get in and how long to hold.

It's important you have an understanding for what you will do if/when your investment in TQQQ goes down 30 percent. Or 60 percent. Or 90 percent. Will you hold, sell, or buy more? When we experience another [2007-2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bear_market_of_2007%E2%80%932009) where the S&P lost 50% of it's value and NASDAQ lost 54 percent, it will be terrifying for many investors in the market.

hnosm8y,"\>Why would buy-and-hold be a bad strategy if they can return over 100% YTD?

It's not a bad strategy. I've been holding LETFs mid-term since 2019. Mostly I hold them for months (buy when there's a dip, sell when I feel they are high enough and when I get good profit (like 70% for example), but some ETFs I've been holding for 1-2 years.

\>Seems like having a % of your portfolio allocated to something risky might be a good thing.

Absolutely.

At first, I invested $1000 into 4 LETFs, made good profit, invested more, made good profit again, etc. Now 2/3 of my portfolio is in LETFs.

You can start small & maybe invest into 2x ETFs. When you get some experience you can invest more and into 3x LETFs.

hnmo9cq,"These type of ETFs tend to fall apart in choppy markets. There's something called volatility decay. This volatility destroys your returns much faster over time. They're the wrong tool for a multi-day position. They are designed for short term trading. They can be insanely risky due to this volatility decay.

For clarity, say you have two ETFs - one regular and the other 3x leveraged. They'll track the same index but, due to 3x losses and gains both being amplified, this can result in the leveraged ETF underperforming it's counterpart and the underlying index. Because any loss to the leveraged ETF is so devastating when amplified, the ETF can reliably only beat the index if volatility is minimal. And you're unlikely to get 3x the returns you were expecting due to the amplification on it's swings. Also, consider you hold long-term and the fund drops 33%. In this case, a 3x leveraged ETF would be completely wiped out.

As well, because of their nature, they're actively managed, so typically they have higher expense ratios. 

They sound good in theory but volatility decay affects them too greatly. If your goal is to 'invest' there's just no point. You're better off simply buying the index fund and being patient.

For inexperienced traders, these are a big risk. Also, with inflation high, talks of a market crash, etc. There's alot of factors in play that could create more market volatility. Now's not really the time to use these.",1638906126,1,ETFs,rasbb4,/r/ETFs/comments/rasbb4/leveraged_etfs/hnmo9cq/
