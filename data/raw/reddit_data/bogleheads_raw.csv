ncatqb7,"I think by definition, the future longterm expected returns HAS to be lower right? You gain 1.5x wins and loses of the market at 1x the price, but the leverage in itself costs the manager money and time and thus fees to execute, and the leverage comes with interest added as well; the most basic form of leverage is borrowing money, with interest, to buy stocks.

so you actually get less than 1.5x the wins and more than 1.5x the losses when you account for the added cost of of leveraging and the fees you pay to the manager for executing the leveraged trade

ncavpxm,"There is a cost to using other people's money even when that money comes in many different forms (options, levered etfs, straight up margin, etc..) . That will reduce your return. If you reset daily then the sequence of returns matters in a very big way because you are selling and buying every day to accomplish that reset.

If you don't reset daily (e.g. you just borrow on margin) then you can still run into a margin call and lose the mother of all sequence of returns games on a bigger scale.

And then there is the risk simply that net returns - after the cost of other people's money - will simply be negative. That's the hurdle.

Historic returns are greater than the cost of capital so leverage does work out on average. but this average is a lot harder to be sure of than simple real returns.

So those are the dangers.

I think the right place for a little leverage is just as margin/portfolio-loans to avoid selling and realizing capital gains while waiting for the death step up. (i.e. buy borrow die).

ncbxb5p,"~~As I said, they only experience decay in the sense that you think about their returns in terms of relative percentages, rather than absolute dollar amounts. If you think in terms of absolute dollars, there is no decay. And it can generally make sense to value assets by determining an absolute dollar value of the asset vs trying to determining a relative percentage change from current valuation.~~

~~Consider eg. a cash fund that returns income to owners at some floating interest rate. The value of that floating rate in any given period can be used to perfectly determine the absolute price in dollars of units of the fund during that period. The asset price during a period isn't determined as a relative % change to the asset price in the preceding period. You don't even need to know the price in the preceding period to value it today.~~

~~Now stocks aren't as easy to value like this, there is a lot more uncertainty about the value of future cashflow, and there is an aspect of momentum in stocks where preceding relative price changes do actually effect current market valuations. But the principle roughly applies.~~

~~If the expected future cash flows drops, and then returns back to the same level, we'd expect the asset price to drop and then return back to the same level. The expected future cash flows don't have to be higher to return the asset price back to the same level, because the valuation method is determining an absolute price in dollars.~~

Yes, and interestingly in some specific cases you would even enjoy higher return. The greater the volatility during a period, the more the drag will be an issue. So, if an underlying index was highly volatile over a few years but ended at the same price as it started, a ratio below 1.0x would have a positive return while the 1.0 index has a 0% return (and any leverage above 1.0x would be a negative return).",1756974979,6,Bogleheads,1n7vyub,/r/Bogleheads/comments/1n7vyub/why_is_it_dangerous_to_use_leverage_etfs_if_you/ncc8ypa/

ngj13e4,"A 20% loss followed by a 20% gain is a net decrease in the market. When the market declines, 0x leverage is of course ideal, because you’re not exposed to the decline in the market. The less exposure you have to a declining market, the better. I think that is intuitive and not surprising.

The issue with volatility decay is a bit more nuanced than can be shown in two time periods of return. If you change the example to be a 20% loss and then a 25% gain, this gets you back to your starting index value. In that example, you will still find that 0.5x exposure is better than 1x exposure. 

That doesn’t mean 0.5x (or 0x) is better for a long term investor. An investor is investing for many days, thousands of days. Most two day periods will not be a large decline followed by a large increase back to the same initial value. There will be many days where the market goes down, many where it goes up, and many where it stays roughly flat. In aggregate, the market goes up over the long run. After many time periods, 0.5x exposure will underperform the 1x exposure over the long term, because it has less exposure to a market with a positive long term return. 0.5x exposure will look better over flat two day periods, but we’re not investing for two days.",1759000668,25,Bogleheads,1ns3f0o,/r/Bogleheads/comments/1ns3f0o/the_flaw_in_the_leveraged_etf_argument/ngj13e4/

nh4xldl,"Oooooh math nice. I think the trouble is how you're thinking about the problem.

Arithmetic means ignore sequence and volatility. 20% gain, 20% loss can be seen as ((1.2 + .8) / 2 ) - 1 = 0%. You're trading evenly. This is more useful for modelling something like a slot machine or coin flip game where you might bet the same amount every game. If you have $100, and bet $1 each game and either gain or lose 20c, you might play for a veeeeeery long time, because your expected return on each game is 0. But not forever because each successive bet is adding volatility. Your expected time to ruin would be proportional to C^2 where

C sub n ≈ Your initial capital + plus a random fluctuation drawn from a normal distribution with a mean equal to your arithmetic mean and variance of σ² × the number of bets n. This follows the Central Limit Theorem essentially. You eventually have ruin even in a positive-mean game. Consider the 25% gain, 20% loss scenario. Even though your expected return each game is a half nickel, eventually you will have a losing streak that wipes out your initial and accrued capital, if you play long enough.

Geometric means on the other hand account for compounding and penalizes volatility. As others have noted 20% gain, 20% loss can be seen as (1.2 * 0.8) - 1= -4%. You're losing value at a mean rate of sqrt(1.2² * 0.8²) ≈ 2.02% . This is typically more useful for modelling investments because your gains and losses typically impact your 'bet size' at a 1:1 ratio (leverage!) for each subsequent 'play'. If you invest $100 in an investment that could be modelled by this return, you might go $100 -> $120 -> $96... Until you have basically no money. As noted also 25% gain, 20% loss or (1.25 * .8) - 1 = 0% breaks even. With no direction this looks like a 'randon walk' when you play the game. $100 -> $125 -> $100 -> $80 -> $100

Leverage then, is related to variable bet sizes in sequential games. So first we need to look at how we optimize variable bets in the real world. Generally, we do this by rebalancing our portfolios for a constant exposure ratio: 60/40, 90/10. You've seen this before. The is best demonstrated by Shannon's Demon. Lets go back one step and instead of betting  100% of our $100 into the geometrically even asset, let's just invest 50% of our money and keep the other half in stable cash. Then, after every game, let's reset our bet size to 50% of our portfolio.

Win:
$50 stock * 1.25 -> $62.50
$50 cash  -> $50
Rebalance: $112.50 total to $56.25 in stock and cash

Lose:
$56.25 stock * .8 -> $45
$56.25 cash -> $56.25
Total: $101.25

Hold up. Geometric mean is +0% how did we make $1.25?! This is the math behind the ""rebalancing premium"" and part of why Warren Buffet suggests 90/10 and not ""100% VOO and chill broski bonds are for suckerzzz"". The Kelly Criterion can be used to find the optimal 'bet size' for a given model bet, but I will leave that to the reader to research.

*TL;DR* So. Finally. Leverage. By using leverage you are amplifying your variance. Instead of +25%, -20%, the game becomes +50%, -40% or even let's look at 3x for +75%, -60%. /The geometric average is penalized by a factor of *about* half σ² (variance) from the arithmetic mean./

This game is still arithmetically positive. ((1.75 + .4) / 2 ) - 1 = .075 You will find leverage multiples arithmetic mean directly. But geometrically sqrt(1.75² * .4²) - 1 ≈  -16.3% Ouch!

The geometrically fair game just became losing.  You can still control 'bet size' but that will only ever do so much to control increases in volatility drag and risk of ruin.

In your example reducing leverage increased a geometrically losing or fair game to having a positive or less negative expected return because reducing leverage reduces the volatility penalty and amplifying a neutral or negative return doesn't help. Keep in mind though, in general the stock market has *increased* in value over time, so it is probably geometrically positive and a small leverage factor may outpace the expansion of the variance penalty a.k.a. volatility drag - as you propose. From what research I've seen on that topic, it has been difficult to estimate this effect well though, with suggestions between about 1.2x to 3.3x being 'optimal'. There are significant risks that go beyond the theoretical modelling of this as well, but if it interests you, you may be interested in looking at a fund like NTSX.",1759295145,1,Bogleheads,1ns3f0o,/r/Bogleheads/comments/1ns3f0o/the_flaw_in_the_leveraged_etf_argument/nh4xldl/

ngj2bud,"You can look at the volatility drag as a function of leverage and volatility:

\*\*E(R\_LETF) = β × E(R\_underlying) - (β² - β) × σ² / 2\*\*

Where:

\- β = leverage

\- E(R\_underlying) = e.g. S&P 500 annual return

\- σ = estimated annual volatility

The last term is volatility decay which scales as the square of volatility, with a pre-factor of 3 for β=3, factor of 1 for β=2.  And 0.375 for β=1.5, obviously approaching zero as you remove leverage and β approaches 1.

Typical annual volatility for S&P 500 is \~15% to 20%. During 2020 it was 30%, but in 2017 it was just 11%. Obviously if you use less diversified indices, you will get higher volatility.

See the table of estimated volatility below:

**2015:** 20%   
**2016:** 18%   
**2017:** 11%   
**2018:** 20%   
**2019:** 16%   
**2020:** 30%   
**2021:** 18%   
**2022:** 25%   
**2023:** 17%   
**2024:** 15%

Then you can try to estimate the volatility decay for various values of leverage. For example, for 2015 and beta=2, it is 4%, etc.

ngkmddi,"Volatility decay is one piece. While the market will trend upward over the long run, it is volatile over the short run, and daily leveraged portfolios will underperform during these volatile periods, dragging down returns. 

Using the same example mentioned above, imagine a 20% decline followed by a 25% increase, which returns you to your original value for an unleveraged portfolio. For a 2x leveraged portfolio, this would result in a 10% loss. For a 1.5x leveraged portfolio, this would result in a 3.75% loss. Both of these leveraged portfolios would do better than the unleveraged portfolio during long stretches of positive days, but you're ultimately ending up with the product of every single return over your investment lifetime, and those volatile periods can cause the leveraged portfolio to underperform despite a positive overall return.

For an example of this in action, take a look at TSLL, which is a 2x leveraged Tesla ETF. Since its inception on August 12 2022, it has a price return of -20.7%. It has distributed a few dividends, which I'll estimate would bring the total return to around -14%. Now, take a look at the underlying TSLA stock. Since August 12 2022, it has returned +46.8%. An investor who thought on August 12 2022 that Tesla would increase over the next 3 years would have lost 14% of their money by buying a 2x leveraged fund on it instead of just holding the underlying asset, which would have earned them a positive 46.8% return.

But the upside is you retain the low cost of ETFs, magnified by your margin, although a significant chunk of that will go back into paying the interest on your margin loan.

The EFTs that are inherently leveraged are terrible, they are designed for day-trading which is the exact opposite of the philosophy of this sub.

This will be a hot take here, but the data shows a modestly leveraged portfolio is likely to produce higher returns in long (40 years or so) time horizons. 

The simulations and backtesting are covered on “Just Keep Buying” by Nick Maggiulli; with illustrations. 

The problem?

Well, you are taking on a lot of risk that sounds easy when markets are doing great… but that won’t always be the case. Heck, in the book Nick even mentions a backtesting where portfolio balance went to almost 0 - it eventually recovered but the point is, who can stomach that in the real world?

So, your question was “does it make sense…”.?

What you have to ask yourself instead is can I handle the risk, volatility, more complex glide path, and small chance of ruin… for the POSSIBILITY of outsized returns when all is said and done?

For me, that bar is very high.

You shouldn’t mess with leverage if you don’t know what you are doing, or if you haven’t mastered the fundamentals (why diversify? why index investing? etc.). But other than that leverage is simply a tool in the toolbox of your otherwise already-balanced portfolio. 

If you are just starting out with leverage, I’d recommend starting here: https://www.lifecycleinvesting.net/

The basic concept is that, if you are younger, you theoretically have more time to recover if/when the market shits the bed. You also have less to lose. It therefore follows that you might prefer to take on additional risk in your portfolio (no different from factor-tilting) by diversifying across *time*, in addition to standard diversification practices, which has the upside of *potential* greater returns over time. 

No portfolio should exceed leverage in excess of 25% of your total holdings. All the standard caveats about market timing still apply.",1727211221,3,Bogleheads,1fol0ug,/r/Bogleheads/comments/1fol0ug/if_i_am_holding_for_the_long_term_does_it_make/lor3cto/

ndrlqm3,"it's a somewhat superficial article. There are  many legitimate issues with LETF, but they are discussed poorly (like volatility drag) but by the time they got to ""Market Volatility"", ""Buyer Beware"" and ""Tax Considerations"", it's clear they ran out of knowledge or just had ChatGPT write it for them. My favorite part at the end is this whole Tax Consideration section: *""Leveraged ETFs are generally taxed unfavorably as compared to non-leveraged ETFs. The author is not qualified to comment on the taxes, but this is something one should seek out a proper advice from their tax professional.""*

I wouldn't blindly advocate for leverage for everyone (or anyone who doesn't fully understand it), and definitely not at x3, but it's important to remember that everyone who ever bought a house uses a form of leverage, often starting at x5.

A crucial question for anyone considering leverage is to ask yourself - if you consider your current NW, and someone offers you a coin flip to double it or lose it all, would you take it? And any time you gamble with other people's money, they will want a cut.

However - studies show that some modest leverage does make sense in some situations, especially someone very young who can take on some risk over 40+ year period, but modest amount of leverage, say 1.5-2.0 is much safer. And if you do leverage, LETF is better option that actually trying to borrow money at 7% or 6% rate and invest it all. 

""Daily resets"" that are being portrayed as a negative in this article, are actually a ""circuit breaker"" of sorts that prevents a total wipeout in addition to actual stock market circuit breakers. 2 consequent days of 20% losses would completely wipe out anyone doing 3x LETF without ""daily resets"", but daily resets will leave them with 16% of their investment.

Volatility drag scales as (L\^2-L) where L is the leverage, so 6 if L=3, but 2 if L=2, and 1.25 if L=1.5. It's also scaling quadratically with variance, so for 15% variance, and 3x leverage, it's 6\*1.125 or  \~6%, but for 2x leverage it's 2.25%, and for 1.5x leverage it's 0.85%. It's still a drag, of course, but it can be reasonably controlled.",1757654337,2,Bogleheads,1nekc2d,/r/Bogleheads/comments/1nekc2d/the_math_mechanics_and_risks_of_leveraged_etfs/ndrlqm3/

With that in mind you may begin with invest a small portion in a levered instrument such as TQQQ or I'd recommend UPRO/SPXL (3x s&P), perhaps 1% of your portfolio and see how it goes. It certainly has the potential to increase long term gains.

We don’t know but there is a limit somewhere that they would hit that compel them to close it and liquidate. I don’t even know how well ProShares would be holding up as a fund provider in a scenario bad enough. They could go bankrupt or get acquired and liquidate everything. Because these funds are made up primarily of derivatives and not the underlying securities, they are not portable, and liquidation is the last resort which could result in realization of all losses.

Sure, I understand volatility decay and daily resetting. Yes, there are fees and margin cost. 

 I think I feel like most answers are inadequate because my question is less about going full 2-3x leveraged against the index but rather something like 1.2-1.3x. For example holding voo paired with a 2-3x LETF on the spx with some rebalancing to keep the leverage 1.2-1.3x.  Sure, you might have to allocate into the leverage during a drawdown and allocate out in a run up. 

To me it seems like a sort of modified Kelly criterion bet. 

The strategy certainly wouldn’t be for everyone. Your points about need for capital are well taken. And I appreciate the points about the cost of margin.

This article also tells us that synthetic replication of leverage is more efficient that physical borrowing to create leverage.  Not to mention that physical leverage is unavailable to retail investors like me.

*Employing derivatives for generating returns is a method known as ""synthetic replication"" (the flip side of ""physical"" replication, directly borrowing), which is generally more efficient than borrowing to buy the securities of the benchmark.*

Cost of capital goes up when interest rate goes up.  But this is applicable to every kind of leverage.  I would assume that the impact is less with synthetic replication than physical borrowing and buying on margin.  Even if the cost of buying options go up, it will be covered by the expense ratio.

My leveraged ETF (UPRO) appear to use primarily swaps and future contracts.  Again, high interest rates will increase the cost of these instruments, but not enough make a serious dent in the returns.  I don't any any call options in the portfolio.

For instance, I’ve hit a nice round number with UPFO/TMF and I’m ready to take some off the table, investing back into my low cost index fund approach. (I’ve started to do this myself, and mentioned before.) I don’t see why this is inherently bad. I’m just capping how much is in this strategy.

I don’t want to use more of my portfolio with a lower leverage etf, because many of the risk factors are the same: LETF decay being one. And, I’d rather have the higher fees of the LETFs associated with less capital.

I don’t see the clear argument that this is an inefficient way to budget risk. 3x is more risky than 2x, but it’s certainly not obvious that half at 3x plus half at 1x is more risky than everything at 2x. One of these goes to zero much easier than the other! That’s my real risk—the drawdown, not the volatility alone! I recall this is discussed at length in the Hedgefundie thread on bogleheads.org. (I’d have to purge through the hundreds of pages though... :( ). 

The “what if I’m wrong?” test is also much easier passed with less allocated to a higher leverage strategy. This difference could let me sleep better at night.

The mental accounting trick is as good as any other: I’ve committed x capital to this strategy and would like to collect dividends from it, in a non-reinvested kind of way.

gyk1kin,"You're right, returns don't compound like interest. However, when we talk about returns, it's useful to _talk_ about returns as if they did compound.

For example, let's say a security such as a stock returns 10% per year. Since the return is expressed as a _percentage_ of growth over the last year, then the growth will be exponential, i.e. compound: If you start out with $10k, after the first year, it'll be $11k, $12.1k, $13.31k, $14.6k, and so on. After n years, you end up with ($10k + $10k * 10%^n ).

This kind of measurement is called the [compound annualized growth rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp) (also called the geometric mean), and is a way to calculate the average growth of a security. CAGR is also used when calculating the time-weighted rate of return, which is used to accurately measure the return of portfolios that are actively contributed to.

Volatility decay exists even with unleveraged ETFs but it’s much less pronounced, the real issue is the fee drag - from the explicit fund fees and the implied leverage fees. 

Here’s a good post detailing it all. If you follow the user who posted it he did one on TQQQ as well. I posted the UPRO one here since it’s more diversified and the more popular LETF. 

The gist is if you want to make money on TQQQ/UPRO, you need a return of about 8.3%+ for UPRO to break even and TQQQ needs it’s underlying to return about 11%+. That’s assuming historical average volatility levels. Basically, if your return is on the historical average and so is the volatility, you’re better off just holding the underlying.

hwtkp7k,"If a normal stock or ETF goes down say 10% from $100 to $90, going back up 10% only gets you to $99 so you actually need to go up about 11% to get back to where you started (actually that gets you to $99.9 because you really need to go up 11.111111111…% but I said “about”)

A leveraged ETF only exaggerates this. So if the fund goes down 10% on a 2x leveraged fund your value goes down 20%. So they went from $100 to $90 and you went from $100 to $80. Now that same stock goes up 11% they’ll have their $99.9, your $80 will have gone up 22% but you’re only at $97.6. Larger losses are harder to dig out of and a 50% loss will put your holding at zero and then you’re done.

The upside is if it goes up 10% you get a 20% increase. This is why these things day trade a lot so the day trader will buy when they hope for up and sell when they expect downturn. If they’re right a lot they can make a lot.

i5ddxtp,"Math looks correct, but let's see how your examples would respond to moving the other direction.

In the first example your leveraged holding is up 44% and your normal is up 21%. If the market were to go down 17%, your normal ETF would be back about to $100, but your leveraged ETF just went down 34% and is now worth $95. So you really should have been out of the market that day, but there's no way to know it was coming. 

For your second example, the normal ETF would need a gain of 23% to get back to where it started, which would only bring the leveraged ETF up to $96. You'd need a 25.5% gain in the market to get the leveraged ETF back to $100.

Leverage ETFs make it easier to have gains wiped out and harder to recover from losses.

The real market is also less tidy than these examples where it can go up and down all month and be right back where it started or it can have a series of good days for weeks, or a series of bad days for just as long, or whatever random stuff it does while generally trending upward over long periods. When held for a long time, leveraged ETFs will generally accumulate more loss than gains except for periods of really good overall market performance (like the last few years).

jr80b5p,"LETFs have a lot more going on than it seems.

For example, it costs money to borrow in order to leverage. That cost is not included in the expense ratio. It's a difficult to determine ""fee"" that is on top of the expense ratio. If you use a ""sim"" to represent the 3x s&p 500 in back tests, it looks better than it is because the backtest does NOT account for the cost of leverage.

Volatility decay is real and can eat away at returns in a significant way in a sideways market. checkout r/LETFs there was a recent post that does a good job of showing this.

Here is a quick backtest using a sim. This sim does NOT account for the cost of leverage, so the returns look better than they really are.

[Backtest](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2023&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=3&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=true&portfolioName1=3x+S%26P+500+%28sim+-+does+not+account+for+cost+of+leverage%29&portfolioName2=1.65x+S%26P+500+%7C+1.35x+LTTs+%28sim+-+does+not+account+for+cost+of+leverage%29&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VFINX&allocation1_1=300&allocation1_2=165&symbol2=CASHX&allocation2_1=-200&allocation2_2=-200&symbol3=VUSTX&allocation3_2=135)

Note how much better the portfolio with the LTTs acting as a hedge ends up doing. Also note that if you change the start date the outcome varies significantly.

Again. The returns shown in this simulation is NOT accurate because we have no simple way to account for the cost of leverage.

Also, a backtest does not ""prove"" future profitability.

There is much more going on with LETFs than I care to get into here. But easily the most impactful part of holding the LETFs long term is the ""you"". So many think they have ""diamond hands"". They do not. This is a 25+ year strategy. If you exit early you lose. You could be down 70% for literally decades. Going to effectively 0 is NOT impossible.

Never lever up to 3x with your life savings. I put about 5% of my portfolio in leveraged positions. Because I can lose 5% and keep living. Seriously, people kill themselves because they do not understand what they are doing with leverage and overestimate their ability to hold. It's not something to take lightly and YOLO into.

But to backtest accurately you need to set the entire dataset up for the cost of leverage for every period and subtract that from each period's return. So for example, the cost of leverage is very high right now, but was very low over the last decade's bull run.

jrerf96,"If you are looking at the LETF in question on [portfoliovisualizer.com](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/), yes. That will be accurate.

Most LETFs only have a history of about 10 years at most though. That is peanuts. It's not useful to look at just the greatest bull run in investing history. You cannot draw any useful conclusions from it.

So folks tend to create simulations of LETFs that go back much farther. I saw one recently that went back to 1900.

To accurately model those simulations you need to account for the money that you are paying in order to achieve your leverage. In those simulations you have to manually subtract that cost. No tool does this for you.

For example. [This sim is not accurate](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2023&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=true&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=4&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=true&portfolioName1=This+Sim+is+wrong+%3A%28&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VFINX&allocation1_1=300&symbol2=CASHX&allocation2_1=-200).

A couple other things to keep in mind as well. The expense ratio is absurd (1%).

ke6s4vn,"you don't want a daily reset levered fund like SSO. They don't give you 2X long term returns. (\*)

If you're going to do long term leverage you're better off borrowing money and investing that for the long term - that will give you a straight multiplier on returns (minus the cost of capital of course - which can make a very high hurdle rate and a questionable investment.) The simplest way is just a margin account at your broker - you then just buy twice as many shares of VT as you have cash for and let it ride. You can't do margin in a retirement account, but there are other strategies (options, etc..)

kebvndb,"yes - I totally agree with this, but you're not seeing why this is a boglehead problem. You present it as just a tradeoff, but it's actually a much bigger problem than that fundamentally.

If you lever up on margin and buy and hold long term then you will satisfy the main boglehead principle of time in the market rather than timing the market. You're buying the broadest of broad indexes and you will receive its (magnified) return (minus costs). You are not making any fundamental bet other than the usual one that long term results are positive.

If you reset the leverage daily, you are going in and out of the market in order to do that. Sometimes you're reducing the leverage as in my example, and sometimes you're adding leverage (as in yours). That is fundamentally done by buying and selling according to what the market did the day before. That's market timing.

k282wcf,"So I personally use a fair amount of leverage but there are three really important things to consider and there are a lot of good reasons why people don't just naively recommend LETFs and they come with warnings and FINRA seems salivating to get rid of them (pretty sure the only LETF allowed on vanguard is NTSX not sure if that's still the case).

1. Leverage is dangerous. You will get insane drawdowns. In a situation where you have a two fund portfolio that is 3x levered and both assets go down at the same time by a substantial amount, you can get completely wiped out. Do not just buy and hold these hoping they turn around.
2. I'd highly recommend fully reading through both HFEA threads, the Lifecycle Investing thread, and the modified HFEA thread with ITT. They're long but you owe it to yourself to do so.
3. You need to understand why TMF is going down. Inverted yield curve, borrowing cost, 3x levered on LTT when the yield has increased dramatically. If you did HFEA starting in 1950 and retired 30 years later, you would have retired with a lot less money than someone doing a ""VTI and chill"" strategy or an unlevered lifecycle allocation into bonds. TMF is in a special type of hell right now with no immediate sign of reversal

I hope this comes off as direct advice and not rude but you really need to do the homework before considering such an aggressive strategy it will save you a lot of pain in the long term. It honestly might be best to take an loss, take it as a learning lesson, and revisit your approach - as I mentioned I tend to use a fair amount of leverage, now is not one of those times. One of the core assumptions, I believe it is stated on page 1 of the original HFEA approach is that this will not work in a rising rates environment. Look at LTT & S&P returns in '73-'74, '22, and the weird rate hike cycle in '94 (S&P held water here but you can see how much of a blood bath this would have been had equities had a bad year as an example of a near miss for HFEA getting crushed).

k2x0lj1,"Yeah. I ***JUST*** started to look into the possibility of TLT and TMF while doing full DD on the holdings, prospectus, past rate hikes, past inflation periods, post-WW2 inflation/growth/rates given the correlation to our high debt, potential of further rate hikes, etcetcetc 

And IF I complete my full research, believe it's a good investment, and see an opportunity to go in then I'd probably start going in slowly into TMF or TLT since the bond market and Fed moves slowly. Probably DCA into it over the span of 1 year isn't even fast since the trade can be very rewarding on the upside, but one might have to go in with the intention of holding 5 to +10 years. And even that assumes certain things like the fund not getting closed, US not defaulting, eveyone not getting nuked to death, inflation coming down instead of going up which would force the Fed to further hike rates, etcetcetc. It's not the stock market which is trying to predict the economy 6-9 months into the future. The Fed looks at backwards data.

k2x8oa0,"Excellent post. I would appreciate it if you could give me your opinions on a few things since I'm not invested in TMF like OP but I've TMF's decline and potential upside has also caught my eye. 

I understand most of your post and would agree with you on almost all of it. OP certainly didn't make the right choice being on the opposite side of Ackman who was short LTTs while being long STT. I think even Buffett who has experience through the 70-80s inflation also didn't go into bonds opting for short term bills too. So OFC the answer has been being in HYSA cash, money market, or something like SGOV.

However, I wondering if you're just explaining the reasons why OP is taking a loss or if you're actually thinking that TLT/TMF moving forward will still be bad?

>Inverted yield curve, borrowing cost, 3x levered on LTT when the yield has increased dramatically. If you did HFEA starting in 1950 and retired 30 years later, you would have retired with a lot less money than someone doing a ""VTI and chill"" strategy or an unlevered lifecycle allocation into bonds. 

Yield curve inversion is a problem and there's no saying that inflation won't pick back up forcing the Fed to further hike rates or that the Fed won't just holding for longer which would mean LTT yields will have to go up even higher and TLT/TMF going down even more.  

Yet the yield curve inversions are a lot closer righting itself as it's mainly flattened now to the point where maximum inversion gap being [sub-1%.](https://www.gurufocus.com/yield_curve.php)  Also, we are now much closer to the Fed's 2% target inflation with CPI and PCE both ticking up only slightly (imo think a small upward tick in inflation is a good thing as a lower high and lower low staircase would be what a soft landing looks like rather than the nosedive we've had since last summer which might mean we overshoot into the downside into recession). Given the rapid rate by which the Fed has increased hikes, the transitory (but delayed) nature of our recent inflation, and the decline of inflation so far gives me reason to believe we don't have the upward increasing waves of inflation (although unprecedented money printing and M2 might say otherwise).

In the case where inflation falls to 2%, then the Fed will likely cut their interest rates as high rates will [cost the US a very hefty tax servicing bill that will rise even more as our old debts roll into higher rates](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A091RC1Q027SBEA) and said cuts would which would correct the short-long inversion. Then there is the scenario where we would go into recession also likely forcing the Fed to cut rates thereby fixing the inversion. And in the case where, the Fed really does continue to hold at current rates then LTT yields will eventually adjust. The prior 2 scenarios would create a rapid shift on the TLT/TMF and the latter scenario would mean they would still go down a bit more but eventually bottom. I personally don't think the Fed wants to keep rates that high but has to take a hawkish tone to crush inflation since the US government debt is at a record +120% of GDP and servicing that debt at +5% is likely unsustainable. 

Either way, I think the upside potential of something like TLT and TMF could be worth the massive risks. Not saying that one should being putting a significant portion of their portfolio or that they should be putting it all in now. But maybe 10% of a portfolio eventually allocated to these and maybe a 10% allocation of that 10% to start a position before the end of the year assuming the Fed pauses on their hike?

Separating TMF and TLT:

TMF is a mess at the moment. I'm not going to crunch the numbers, frankly because it's so far from close to a good investment unless you're in a space constrained portfolio and like crazy high into LETFs on the equities side (like HFEA I get it, I'm not a HFEA fan but totally understand the need to hold TMF to make that strategy feasible for those who subscribe to it). Borrowing 3x to buy a fixed income instrument with a 1%ish worse yield. So that's about 3% cost. Management fee, let's say that's 4% total. Volatility decay varies of course but 2% is a conservative estimate. So your holding cost in a flat market right now with the same depths and highs of oscillating around a fixed price are like minimum 6%. CAGR for TLT this year is -9.23%. 3x that is -27.69%. TMF performance is -35.54% so ya, TMF itself has been really bad compared to TLT this year even accounting for the fact that it's a bad market for LTT. I'm just not buying anything where I know I give 6%+ in holding cost ever and that was a guess who knows where it will go but it was closer to 8% YTD.

TLT though, doesn't have those issues. Like you said it's high risk high reward. I don't hold it but I think it's totally reasonable particularly you're predominantly long equities even though I'd prefer BND if it's a long term portfolio and not levered in like a 80/20 type risk tolerance.

So that said, I have no doubt there is a very good chance TLT is a great trade but I am way too bearish on it at the moment.

This really gets into non-BH stuff and feels like sinning in a church if you want my more nuanced opinion on going long TLT right now though:

* The yen carry trade has had an outright messy couple months. I'm totally cool letting the dust settle on LTT. I think LTT is abnormally high risk ATM and it's impossible to know how much price is being impacting by the yen vs the fed. I just don't believe the price of LTTs react quickly to information. Sinning, yes I know, they scare the hell out of me when there is not a clear trend and there's so many situations where LTT pricing did not react rationally IMO. Someone on CNBC facetiously said they trade like meme stocks a couple weeks back. I can't say I disagree. LTT behavior is so inexplicable to me I'd in general say I'm a semi-strong or weak EMH believer. LTT pricing makes me question even being a weak EMH believer the information->price lag seems that insane to me to the point where I do have gone short LTT exposure solely based on real yields and inflation momentum. I have never gone short any other security once based on my opinion of value and there being a momentum factor. So that's my overall opinion of the LTT market :-)
* I trust in the equity risk premium. I'd just rather have risk premia on equities than bonds in general but it's negative duration premium that really pushes me over the edge. Reinvestment risk is real too though so to each their own but I like the shorter end. Different risks but I'd rather manage reinvestment risk at the moment than have to hold negative duration premium in hope of a reversal.
* Risk-adjusted returns for LTT are really rough compared to a lot of other securities including other treasuries. They have a 40+ year existence including an awesome run for 95% of that time and consistently have worse risk-adjusted returns that other parts of the yield curve. I am pretty sold on leverage aversion hypothesis explaining the implied consistent relatively high price of LTT.

Ackman's bet is interesting. I did short/short spy/LTT for almost 15 months straight and I like to think it was smart but it was also very lucky with how high CAPE was when I entered into it and then Ukraine happened. Short SPY I was holding as hedge against if the short LTT backfired, long STT short LTT is way more aggressive. Sometimes I have a little trouble following his logic TBH but obviously he has a track record of hitting home runs and also rough losses but that's his profile and it pays off the way he trades.

I don't know if Buffett despises any financial instrument more on earth than long term treasuries so color me not the least bit surprised by his actions. He's been trashing LTT since the GFC when they entered into a massive bull market and never backed off once. I think his general argument of ""if I'm buying something for 20 years why not have a risk premium attached to it"" is a really fundamental question about LTT in any portfolio. Sure they are shock absorbers for market crashes sometimes. He handles equity risk with low beta high quality companies and leverage to juice the returns. I'm not Warren Buffett so I buy STT and ITT to hedge and happily collect the duration premium and if my treasuries are down, it's offset by equity gains but I think his point about LTT is true regardless of how one approaches handling equity risk. It's really a question of what kind of insurance do you want and LTT seems like pretty poor insurance in general. Frankly if it were better, it wouldn't have such solid returns because insurance needs to cost something. And if you're buying something for a long duration, and not using it as insurance, you're buying it for gains, so why not buy a stock?

Check out Ray Dalio's comments. He's the one who is actually making me paranoid about my favorite position of leveraged long equities and blended treasury durations. The past two decades he's gone from ""lever up fixed income"" to ""it's great but maybe add more non fixed income to hedge equity"" to ""who the hell is buying bonds in 2021 are those people insane"" to ""the US might lose its status as reserve currency"". I'm not quite there with his current opinion but I think his reasoning is sound enough that if LTT absolutely crater in price, people should be looking at that outcome as a ""1%-10% chance event occurred"" and not ""total black swan no one could have seen this coming"". We are pumping ludicrous amounts of treasury supply onto the market and it's not the majority of demand for them but China is a seller now and Japan is wobbly trending towards a much less aggressive buyer of US debt.

My single largest concern is that the fed can control the interest rate. It cannot control demand outside of QE and it cannot control fiscal policy. I agree with this part, if as you say, the economy goes into a recession the fed will cut rates. This will also make servicing the US debt easier. I think the problem is what next? We always pass stimulus and revenues are lower in recessions with less economic activity and taxation. Tax cuts, the IRA, GFC legislation etc. that increases the deficit and causes more supply on the open market. If demand isn't there to pick it up, it gets hairy really fast. It strikes me as very plausible that debt to GDP is like 140-150%+ by the end of large recession in the next year or so if one occurs. If that recovery coincides with weak treasury demand and the market clearing price for LTT is depreciating, the market is going to dictate yields and it's going to be really really unpleasant for LTT and really everything with our debt level. This would be a pretty serious death spiral for US debt that hasn't happened before to us at least but like any borrower who is accruing more debt and not outpacing the growth of it with revenue, borrowing tends to get more expense.",1696143567,3,Bogleheads,16rzku4,/r/Bogleheads/comments/16rzku4/tmf_is_killing_me_softly/k2yxo0r/

komitds,"There’s a couple issues with it. First, the expense ratio for SSO vs VOO is pretty significant. Second, other than the obvious (in a drawdown it hurts twice as bad), you will get hurt in sideways or high volatility periods. Third, the cost of leverage is much higher than it has been for awhile so there’s much less room for error. If the S&P 500 has a decade like the early 2000s where it goes nowhere, and you’re paying 6%ish for borrowing and ER, it’s going to be painful.

As for TMF, I'm not worried about it at all. Most of the return comes from the 165% equities, with TMF acting in the nick of time for crash insurance. If you plot out simulated UPRO and TMF, you see simulated TMF doubles and then draws down 50% all the freaking time. Then for rising interest rates, bond funds operate differently than an individual bond does! That is because bond funds have convexity. TLT happens to sell the 20-year bond to buy the 30-year bond at auction!

ls7vdwr,"This is a common question so I won’t get that cranky, although Bogleheads wiki explains it. 

The easiest form of explaining this, that I have personally read is in the book *Just Keep Buying*. In a nutshell, theoretical leveraged portfolios (not those daily reset ETF’s but actual hold funds) SHOULD outperform over LONG periods (I think he measured rolling 40 year cycles). But they came at significant volatility, in some cases portfolios going down from a lot to almost $0. The general conclusion is that behaviorally that would be impossible for 99.999% of people to overcome so a more stable strategy is preferred. 

That’s the general feel of why Bogleheads don’t advocate leverage. 

As to your question of why stagnant markets kill returns. Leveraged products have… think of it as an “undocumented expense ratio”, right? Which is the cost of leverage itself. If markets don’t move or take a while to recover (internet bubble comes to mind), then those leverage fees eat away at principal and you actually take longer to recover (assuming the investor didn’t panic and got out of the strategy even earlier). 

The most well-research portfolio that I know of that gets significant discussion even in academic circles ironically came from… Bogleheads forums! It’s HFEA - HedgeFundie’s Excellent Adventure. 

To keep it simple, In this research he is using something that has a new trendy name called “stacking” but dates back to the 70’s in theory and 80’s in systematic practice. Which is the idea that you leverage two uncorrelated assets. 

This has been discussed for ages and taken apart by experts and people way smarter than me. The general conclusion is that it’s a strategy too risky for most investors and that if you really really want to do it, do it with a small portion of the portfolio. 

Finally to your last point. Yes, I use a little bit of leverage on a small portion of my portfolio. Some (I would say small number) Bogleheads probably do it. I do it through one simple, low cost ETF called “NTSX’ but there’s others. These funds do that “stacking” approach all in one. They use margin to buy bonds synthetically on top of the SP500. Whether this ends up working or not…. I am honestly skeptical. That’s why it’s just a small portion of my portfolio.

In volatile periods, leveraged ETFs can underperform relative to the index they track. For example, a 3x leveraged S&P 500 ETF could lose 60% when the underlying index only loses 20%.

lsavwju,"I am sorry to whip out the chalk board and go  all Mat Damon on you.  Sorry!  It really isn't as simple as a Finance 101 class would let you believe.

In Financial theory you can take a loan out at 4.5% (30 year risk free rate) 2 dollars to 1 equity and go 3x into SPY for 3x the volatility and gain.  In practice this doesn't work that way.  First is the issue of credit risk. Here you have a 20% return and 60% volatility.  There is at least a 1.5% chance you will go illiquid in this investment (likely more) over the 30 year period.  So you will have to pay a credit risk premium on this money and margin rates are usually around 10% killing all your gains.

To eliminate this credit risk, well you can rebalance on periods shorter than 30 years.  No instead of having a single 30 year return, you have a multiplication of several shorter period returns.  This creates convexity in your portfolio (a feature not a bug as it prevents you from going bankrupt).  However this convexity will eat away your returns in high volatility environments.  It then turns out that a 3x SPY portfolio because of this effect doesn't perform any better than a 2x SPY portfolio but has 150% the volatility.  If it helps the formula here is 10%\*k - .5\*(18%)\^2\*k\^2 where k= 1,2,3 is the multiplier (kx SPY).  In other words there is an optimal leverage number even if you didn't care about volatility.

Now lets also not pretend like volatility doesn't matter.  The reason why a 30 Year SPY strategy works is that the width of the confidence interval on how small that return diminishes from 2\*18% = 36% in 1 year to 2\*3% = 6% over 30 years.  So unless you are extremely unlucky you will get at least 4% returns.  If you do the same with a 2xSPY well you get a 12% and roughly zero.  You aren't guaranteed any return at all for 2x even on a 30 year period (something for retirement scares me).",1729131155,1,Bogleheads,1g4u5f7,/r/Bogleheads/comments/1g4u5f7/why_not_invest_in_3x_sp500/lsavwju/

To be more technical about it, let me give you a mathematical example.  Say you have a S&P fund without leverage that goes up 10% and then subsequently goes down -10%; you’re down just -1%.  Now consider a 3x leverage S&P fund that goes up 10% x 3 = 30% and then subsequently goes down -10% x 3 = -30%; you’re down -9%.  And that’s just for a market correction which can happen on any given year.  

Now say you have a S&P fund without leverage that goes up 20% and then subsequently goes down -20%; you’re down just -4%.  Now consider a 3x leverage S&P fund that goes up 20% x 3 = 60% and then subsequently goes down -20% x 3 = -60%; you’re down -60%.  If you don’t believe me, go look at how SPXL (a 3x leveraged S&P fund) did in 2022 when the S&P 500 was down -18% for the year (spoiler alert . . . It went down 57% that year, and it took till late June 2024 just to recover to its prior peak, whereas a non-leveraged S&P fund would have recovered fully in Dec 2023.)

Bear markets happen every 4-5 years on average and 20% decline is the minimum to enter a bear market.  If the decline is > 20%, a 3x leveraged long fund can go down even worse.

lsa34na,"Ah okay, I think I see what’s happening on here. The fact is, leveraged funds don’t give you more resources, even on paper. What they do is amplify the *sensitivity* of your resources by some scaling factor.

Instead, I think you’re confusing change in value (wins/losses, as you referred to them) for percent change here. Because yes, $100 in a 3x fund that declines -20% loses `$20x3=$60`…the same as a $300 investment that sinks $60 to $240. BUT -$60 IS A 60% LOSS ON THE *ORIGINAL* $100 INVESTMENT, __not__ a 20% loss on $300 because your investment never *was* $300. If you sold right at the bottom, you would only receive `$100-$60=$40` because this is the actual real value of your investment at this time.

Likewise, yes, recouping $60 to go from $240 back to $300 is `60/240=+25%`. BUT YOUR ACCOUNT IS NOT WORTH $240, IT IS WORTH $40. Recall that percent change is expressed relative to the “beginning” state: `100% x (ending - beginning)/beginning`. So I’m this case, because you’re looking at the performance needed to take your now-$40 investment and increase it back to $100, the fund needs to increase by `$100-$40=$60`, or `60/40=+150%` from its bottom. And because the fund in this hypothetical scenario is 3x, the index underlying the fund must increase by `+150%/3=50%`.

I’ve been doing it in my IRA. I chose to use my IRA because HFEA can incur taxes when you rebalance every 3 months.  

The IRA contribution limit is also useful in that it forces me to DCA over the years. Without a contribution limit I might have gotten emotional and invested more or less year by year. 

I’ve been putting the max in my IRA every year in January since 2020. So I got in right before a historic drawdown (rising rates) 

According to Fidelity my cumulative return is currently -5.6% since March 2020. 

My HFEA position makes up about 2% of my net worth. I do also dabble in NTSX in my taxable brokerage account. But it’s mostly VT and chill. I’d say altogether I am 1.06x leveraged across all of my accounts. 

I do believe in the thesis of HFEA, at least enough to invest 2% of my portfolio in it.

hu9qmgk,"Adding leverage introduces the risk of total loss, however slight, which needs to be a serious consideration since the single most important goal of long-term investing is portfolio survival. Offsetting this risk with another leveraged investment then depends on the persistence of historical correlations to prevent exacerbating the issue. For this reason, a leveraged portfolio HAS to be closely monitored and rebalanced according to strict rules, and can be quite stressful for the uninitiated - simulations of UPRO (3x SPY) for example show it would have dropped something like 92% in 2007-08. The unleveraged investor never has to go to bed or on vacation or into surgery at the hospital with the gnawing concern that a sudden unexpected market shift could bankrupt them if their portfolio is unattended to.

Leverage in the market significantly amplifies the notional values of securities without real liquid capital to back it up - this was a critical ingredient to the crashes of 1929 and 2008, the latter of which involved leveraged derivatives thought to be safe but ended up wiping out investment banks that were generations or even centuries old like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. Many folks suggest using leveraged long-term treasuries to counteract the risks of leveraged stocks for example. But if something very strange and unprecedented happens in those two asset classes at the same time, you could be toast. These things do very rarely occur. 

So it works well in theory, but the road to success in leveraged investing is strewn with ruins of those who flew too close to sun - IMO it should not be treated as some obvious and simple hack to magnifying returns.

hu9dfet,"I am testing some leveraged ETFs. They look great in the historic bull run we have had, but if you had bought TQQQ at the top of the dot com era those shares would still be down like 91% today - sure you DCA the whole time and it helps offset that, but I think a lot of people overestimate their tolerance for risk especially since we’ve been in a massive bull run for a decade+.

Because of the daily reset, this strategy relies much heavier on timing the market - this is not an easy thing to do. If we all knew the right time to buy and sell, as in your examples above, we’d all be multi-millionaires.

The leveraged portion of my portfolio (it’s small because, as I said, I am testing) is down 20% this last month. In a way I am grateful for this correction so that I can gauge my mood and behavior with the added risk.

I would never leverage anything close to 100% if my portfolio, probably not anything over 20% honestly.

In an environment where they are generally going up, it’s great (insane returns as you say), but sideways trading has a severely negative impact on leveraged ETFs which just track the daily change, and not change over time (as well as corrections/crashes but I figure we all know those are not favorable for a buy-and-hold portfolio).

So all said if you can stomach seeing your portfolio down possibly 20-80% and commit to DCA, quarterly rebalancing, and preferably a hedge like TMF it’s doable.

'Simulated' being the keyword there -- anyone can simulate a winning strategy in hindsight. IIRC, the *actual* strategy as described by its creator only dates back a few years, and is thus literally a product of this bull market. We can disagree (and neither of us can know either way), but to me it seems more than coincidence that a leverage-oriented strategy appeared and became popular in the late stages of a long bull market.

> completely disregarding the entire hundreds upon hundreds of threads on the Bogleheads site about HFEA itself.

https://www.afrugaldoctor.com/home/leveraged-etfs-and-volatility-decay-part-2

Take it with a grain of salt especially the 2x + 1x = 1.5x leverage bit, that's not reality. It is written by a psychiatrist and I find takes from non-financial people click differently and can approach the same concept from a new angle that may be easier to understand for some.

Last I checked optimal ratio over ~30y was calculated at something like 1.7x? I forget where I saw that or I would link. Realistically from there though Kelly Criterion would suggest you do a fraction of that, like 1/2 or 1/3. So you really want to find like a ,1.3x or 1.4x or so leverage ETF. But then you also still need to compete on the expense ratio with the 1x ETFs at 0.03% expense...

Of course you could use your own debt outside the market as a sort of pseudo margin, but good luck borrowing at anything close to the risk free rate.

And so probably best to just avoid the issue altogether. As with other aspects. Yes, there is probably room for marginal improvement, but the behavioral and fee based pitfalls along the way will likely render the pursuit of that a negative for most people.",1704377871,2,Bogleheads,18yc10z,/r/Bogleheads/comments/18yc10z/leveraged_etfs_in_401k/kga3qbi/

Aside from the extra risk - whether that is or isn't worth for you depends on your risk tolerance and your objectives, but as a general principle I think it's a mistake to take more risk than you *have* to in order to have a good chance to achieve your objectives - one thing I don't like about leveraged ETFs is the counterparty risk.

I mean, just as a 3x-leveraged ETF suffers from volatility decay compared to its non-leveraged counterpart, a non-leveraged ETF would suffer from volatility decay compared to its hypothetical 0.33x ""anti-leveraged"" counterpart (the numbers would be exactly the same); and yet, not many would recommend something like that. 

...ok, thinking about it, bonds in one's portfolio can be thought of as sort of similar to an ""anti-leveraging"" of that kind, more or less; but still, not many would recommend a 66%+ bond allocation for investors in the accumulation phase.

hvcphnd,"You sure about that? You should expect 3x the results on an annualized basis, NOT 3x the totality of return over multiple years.

Since March 2010, TQQQ has returned 50.76% and QQQ has returned 20.36%.

50.76 / 20.36 = 2.49 the annualized return.  

That difference from a full 3x is the higher expense ratio and the decay over time.

hve6u4s,"Good point about bonds, that’s exactly what author of that blog mentioned in 2nd article. If you’re all in into stocks your leverage is equal 1, it goes down if you remove money from the markets and goes up if you borrow more money to enter the market

In the 2nd article he mentions a paper where some scientist argued that mathematically there is nothing special about leverage equal “1” and that if you backtest with SP500, the optimum leverage is somewhere around 2

That being said higher returns come with higher volatility. Just as deleveraging (going into cash or bonds) is done to reduce volatility one has to understand that leveraging will increase it. And increased volatility is problematic from the point of view of Bogleheads because a lot of “universal truths” stops working. “Markets over time will go up” is true if you assume leverage = 1 and “over time” to be at least 20 years.

If it's in an exchange, there still very real risk in it being hacked or stolen by insiders even if you're with the most trustworthy of them all. What about the risk of your country suddenly banning it? Or your bank blacklisting you for having it?

Bitcoin can go to zero because of a loss of confidence, scandal, the return of Satoshi, something crazy like quantum computing, environmental concerns, or something else taking its place on merit alone (it's pretty shit at most of what it actually does as an asset).

I think if you adjust for all the risks, a triple leveraged ETF is probably ""safer"" on paper. However, I think a blue chip cryptocurrency has more upside for a longer period of time.

HOWEVER there is one instance where I might consider it. The instance is- say you have a small amount of money in a Roth IRA, like <10% of your portfolio. Your income level goes above the threshold for contributing, and Congress passes a law closing the back door so you can no longer put money in that account. You might actually have no way to make additional contributions.

hni1ven,"Reducing the Risks of Black Swans**

-	Current stock market valuations play a very important role in determining future returns
-	Shiller CAPE 10 ratio is a good ratio to think about future returns.
-	Higher ratio = lower future returns. Lower ratio = higher future returns. But there is a wide dispersion of potential outcomes
-	Your labor capital should play a role in your risk in your portfolio. More stable job = more risks in the portfolio. Less stable job = less risks in the portfolio
-	Tilting the portfolio adds the important consideration of tracking error regret. Tracking error is the amount by which a portfolios performance varies from that of the total market.
-	You basically have a little bit of super risky assets and a lot of very conservative assets. Nothing in the middle. This lowers the tail risk of the portfolio both to the positive and negative (lowers standard deviation of the portfolio).

If you're lump-sum investing in the IRA at the beginning of the year, every three months you'd want to reset each to your desired target allocation.

This time last year, the sub was in ""need to move to cash, stocks are so risky, my risk tolerance was lower than I thought"" spam mode, now we seem to be entering the ""buy 3x leveraged stock ETFs"" spam mode. As Bogle said, ""they were bearish when they should have been bullish, and bullish when they should have been bearish!""

The reasons not to buy 3x leveraged ETFs are mostly based on the fact that they are not built to hold long term. These are funds built for intra-day risk management of hedge funds and the like. They will trend toward zero (and many have gone to zero) in any volatile market due to their structure, and they are overpriced even relative to their fundamentals. It is an inappropriate way to invest, because it takes an ungodly amount of uncompensated risk, and operates as an implicit bet against volatility (which is totally unjustifiable on boglehead or academic finance grounds), all with a 1% per year fee that cripples its future returns in the long run. I guess I will be posting this for a long time, or actually, until the next crash or period of low returns when people will then react in the exact opposite direction.  


PS: 2x leveraged ETFS =/= 2x leverage. Leverage can be good in many circumstances, but not this kind!

The 3x leveraged will give better returns than 3x the market if there is constant movement (upward or downward)

For 5 days with a 5% down movement:

    Market:  0.95^5 - 1 = -22.6%
    3x daily: 0.85^5 - 1= -55.6%
    3x Market: 3*(-22.6%) = -67.9%

    Market: 1.05^5 -1 = +27.6%
    3x daily: 1.15^5 -1 = +101%
    3x Market: 3*(+27.6%) = +82.9%

So the leveraged etf did better than 3x the market return for those examples.

hb15tu2,"These are terribly interesting products. That might be a red flag. :)

As I understand it, the investments in NTSX are effectively 90/60 S&P 500/Treasuries. 1.5 levered but all the leverage is on the bond side via futures contracts. 

I’m attracted to it as it seems to let me shift to a 40% bond position which may be more age appropriate. Otherwise with some math magic I can stay at 20% bonds but I lose some of the leverage value. 

My open questions/concerns are:

1. Should I shift my bond %. I suspect no one can answer that for me :). I’m 46 so that suggests yes. I’d love to retire early so that also suggests yes. I may not retire early for various reasons that are both not financial and not in my control so that suggests no. 

2. Is replacing BNDW with treasuries really a good plan? Treasuries seem to be more negatively correlated with the other assets, but the whole thing calls into question why I picked BNDW in the first place. It was because I needed bonds and I’m an American living overseas so having some international bond made sense. 

3. What about international and keeping my VT like global market cap split. Using VXUS reduces the leverage some. NTSI is new and I can’t figure out how their selected basket of 500 international shares is chosen and how it should relate to something like VXUS. Replacing VTI with what is basically VOO is an easy decision.",1630395861,1,Bogleheads,pcqe3t,/r/Bogleheads/comments/pcqe3t/using_leveraged_etfs_to_change_portfolio/hb15tu2/
hb1xcfw,"1. As you said, the level of risk you want to undertake is entirely up to you. If you want to continue to maximize accumulation while still hedging drawdowns, something like NTSX is a reasonable way to do that, but at best it’s still only going to perform like a less volatile S&P fund. A decade like the 00s would still be rough for someone all in on NTSX, but then that would also be true of an 80/20 portfolio. 

2. As I mentioned before, treasuries generally offer an uncorrelated to negatively correlated position to equities. Something like BND will likely get better rates, but at this point you’re really just looking at your bond position to hedge your equity position, which means you want something that’s going to zig when stocks zag to lessen drawdowns and recovery times. Treasuries do that, and they do that much better than corporate bonds. International government bonds aren’t going to add much to that equation. 

3. To maintain international, just add an international fund like VXUS as you normally would. Since NTSX is mostly meant to work like a less volatile S&P fund, you can basically use it as a replacement for your core US holding, which is generally how Wisdomtree envisioned it would be used: https://www.wisdomtree.com/-/media/us-media-files/documents/resource-library/wisdomtree_ntsx_faq.pdf

The huge risk comes with the daily reset objective. Swaps and futures are utilized to gain the extra exposure of the underlying index so the financing cost the fund incurs to hold these derivatives are passed onto the shareholder. Thus the daily exposure isn't exact: meaning 1% up on NDX will not be exactly 3% on TQQQ or -3% on SQQQ (the inverse version). 

Leveraged funds are tactical tools, DEFINITELY not buy/hold for the average, uninformed investor.

i8krluj,"I was always interested in HFEA and think it has merit as a clever way to beat the market and I got a little bit of FOMO over it but was concerned that 3x was too clever by half. For a hot second last decade I considered HFEA in my Roth but I could never invest in it myself for a few reasons:

1. The concern you expressed: that it turns out to be a rosy data mining product - one of those “too good to be true” ideas where it seems like beating the market is easy. “What could possibly go wrong?”. We know we’ve had 10-year drawdowns in the S&P 500 this century and that is obvious in backtests. But [the last major bear market in long treasuries](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2022/03/what-does-a-bond-bear-market-look-like/) (1960-1981) predates much of the available backtesting data. That bond bear market started with interest rates higher than we’ve had in recent years and collided with inflation like we are seeing now. Put 2 + 2 together and imagine what would happen with another 10-year US stock bear market AND a 20-year US long treasuries bear market, and you are looking at potentially a very, very deep and long portfolio drawdown.

2. These leveraged ETFs are still fairly novel products and we don’t know exactly how they will behave. There is talk of regulating them and many platforms have already or are considering restricting them. If you have a leveraged ETF portfolio with a deep long, drawdown, the losses will be compounded by the high expense ratios (close to 1% for UPRO and TMF), the impact of increasing borrowing rates on the leverage, and volatility decay from the daily leverage resets. It’s even possible that in a long treasuries bear market that the combination of NAV decline and outflows could cause a fund like TMF to close and then you are SOL. This is one reason that some have warned these high leverage ETFs are not meant for long term use - will they be around long enough for you to recover from deep drawdowns or will you just get liquidated at a huge loss? Time will tell but that’s not a risk I am willing to take.

3. I want to be retired in 10-15 years. I don’t want a portfolio that has the potential for a 15-20 year drawdown that could take (who knows?) 30 years to recover. I think a portfolio diversified into US/Intl stocks (including small caps) and short/int bonds is going to be much more reliable for my timeframe. More importantly, I don’t *need* to outperform the market to reach my goals - just 5% CAGR in 15 years will get it done -  so there’s not much sense in taking the risk of underperforming it. Many folks in HFEA are feeling a LOT of stress right now and watching market returns daily and I don’t need that in my life.",1652536356,6,Bogleheads,upbzkg,/r/Bogleheads/comments/upbzkg/hedgefundies_excellent_adventure_update_this/i8krluj/

People forget that HFEA is a yield play on bonds as well, so higher interest rates actually help to buffer lower equity returns. 

2) I'd say this is actually the biggest risk to the strategy. Although we haven't had any major issues with 3x leveraged funds utilized in the strategy, and I don't anticipate the will be any... There is the potential of looming regulation to lock retail investors out of leveraged products.

Neglecting volatility decay, you lose less than 3x the underlying on the way down and gain faster than 3x the underlying on the way up. It's volatility that is the demon; but frequent rebalancing can help take advantage of volatility by ratcheting as funds oscillate.

In your example, with no volatility the drop in the 3x portfolio would have been about 2.7x the underlying (32.4% loss, leaving 48% to make up) and the rise would have been about 3.4x the underlying. The point that the 3x LETF recovery takes longer stands in this example, but maybe not quite as bad as it looks. 

With double the drop, again with no volatility, the 3x would only drop 2.4x the underlying and would recover about 4x the underlying.  So it would putatively recover faster than the underlying.

I launched this great strategy in 2019. It was 'buy all Apple stocks.' It backtests super well, too! Seriously, though, if we can just make up portfolios that work in hindsight, the game is easy. Alas, that doesn't work. In fact, hang around here long enough and you'll see this pattern over and over again: people come up with a cool new strategy, it works for a while, and then it stops working. Rinse and repeat.

> At any rate, it has outperformed the market as a whole drastically in that timeframe despite a major drawdown in an environment that is, again, essentially the worst-case scenario for this particular portfolio.

No, the worst case scenario for this portfolio wasn't 2020, when stocks went down but safe bonds went up. The worst case is what's unfolding right now, which I outlined in my original post. That's literally what the post is about.

i8m2kix,"I mean I’ve said this a few times now but most people doing HFEA do not have HFEA as a substantial part of their portfolio, so most people who are invested in HFEA have not actually seen their assets drop 50% (why are you excluding bonds from risk assets as well?).  But most importantly, even if it drops more than 50%, this doesn’t actually mean it’s a good or bad strategy (especially if you care long term, which if you’re undertaking a very risky investing strategy, that should be all that matters).

Re: your last comment - hopefully most people who are investing in HFEA can stomach such downturns, because if they weren’t ready to stomach a full loss of principal in HFEA, they shouldn’t have invested in it.  I’m probably down 30-40% on it and couldn’t care less to be honest.

l8qzkok,"It's great you recognized the problem. I'm a Bogle Head and a compulsive gambler. If there's one thing I've learned it's that I have to keep my interactions with my investments to a minimum.

What starts as a rebalancing exercise for me can turn into exploring some new investment type; before I know it I'm leveraged on options and own crypto. It's not that I don't understand when I self sabotage my investments; it's a mental compulsion that occurs when I'm coping with other things.

I share this hopefully as a warning story about how slippery a slope it is from passive index investing to the casino, if you develop an addiction. Not saying you have this addiction, but it's not something I ever thought I could have until just a few years ago. So take the possibility seriously.

I now have my brother as a trusted party on accounts I can trade, so that he's alerted to any trades. This is a great deterrent but only the second line of defense. I also don't have UI access to Fidelity where all my tradable accounts are. If I need to rebalance or something else, I have to call in and speak to a human.

You get 2x the daily return for a given day.

There’s no espacing the two sides of leverage of any kind. It can push you much further from your goals just as easily as accelerate the path toward it.

l8rgg3b,"This article about [the efficient market hypothesis](https://thedeepdish.org/efficient-market-hypothesis-is-not-dead/) got me to internalize the logic of widely diversified index funds. Perhaps it'll help you to internalize the logic too.

Ultimately, whenever you see some good gain recently, that just means you missed it. You can't know any of it ahead of time. Unless you have insider information?

The whole market, it's all random. And even if you can find some advantage, it's just as hard getting out at the right time as getting in. And is there anything new that you know that the market doesn't with you buying these funds?

Anyway, the best thing to do is to get it out of sight and out of mind.

Two things. You should just buy a Target Date *Index* Fund. Even if you believe you're finding something more optimal, surely it would make sense that buying global stocks and a touch of bonds is mostly optimal? Have it in one thing that's mostly optimal that you won't be tempted to fuck with.

If you're at Schwab, Fidelity, or Vanguard for your IRA, those have their own index based TDFs to pick from. Choose the year when you turn 65, or close to it. If you're at Robinhood, choose something like ITDI, which is Blackrock iShares's index based TDF ETF for year 2065.

But ideally, just have it be in a different account and app. If you're at Robinhood, move it to one of the other three. If you're locked into the IRA at Robinhood due to their bonuses, perhaps try trading in the taxable elsewhere.

>I was thinking of giving myself some play money in brokerage so i can have a less-consequential place to make those kind of bets. I really dont want to fuck with my retirement. 

Ultimately, this, or paper trading, is gonna be the key.

You truly need to do something to set and forget it. Retirement is years and years from now. Perhaps sooner, if you stop fucking with it.

Fiddling with stuff like this shouldn't be your hobby. If you want your hobby to make you money, find a different hobby where you can directly make money with it.

The beauty of investing is that it's actually optimal to set and forget it. And that's what will make you tons of money.

Sure, you won't be a millionaire tomorrow. But personally, at my savings rate, I'm going to be a millionaire within a decade.

For stuff that's more actionable, you may enjoy other financial stuff. I love r/fire and r/financialindependence. I love [the coastFI calculator](https://walletburst.com/tools/coast-fire-calc/). I love [the Fi flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/16xymii/fire_flow_chart_version_43/), which following is gonna leave me rich. I love reading articles about investing and finance [like this](https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series/). I don't do them as much as maybe I should, but r/creditcards stuff and r/churning stuff is cool and lets you save/make a bunch of money too.

There's a reason they call it dumb money. Don't be dumb money.

And if you must, keep it separate from your retirement. Don't be tempted to check it! Make it annoying to check it!

Staring at the numbers isn't healthy, nor is it beneficial to you.

kd3lxrg,"It's really hard to use leverage well. I'll agree that at a very high level - it should work. investments go up so more invested means more returns.. and equity returns more than loans, so taking the loan side to invest in the equity side is arbitrage. But the time scales are large and the risks are magnified.

let's stipulate that levered etfs are trading vehicles, not investment vehicles because of the daily reset. The funds themselves go out of their way to say this. So BHs don't trade - so those are a nope.

but of course, leverage comes in other forms. options, margin loans, etc. Just generally other people's money (OPM). What about those?

OPM is great - but it always comes at a cost and at the end of the day that cost is driven by interest rates (because the risk free govt bond is what the OP in OPM could always choose to do with their M - so you need to pay them more than that.). Sometimes a lot, sometimes a little - but here's the rub: you cannot adjust your leverage according to the cost because if you do so, you'll be market timing and will not receive market returns. Once that happens, all the BH basics evaporate - you're basically betting on interest rates rather than investing in the economy. So you need to be committed to 1.25x (or whatever) on every dollar, both old and new, no matter the cost.

And that gets hard. And this borrowed money isn't returning 8% on average.. it's returning 3% on average after costs and it has higher volatility. higher volatility may mean you mean more time.. these are timespans that might be longer than many retirement horizons in order to eek out fairly marginal wins.",1702420221,3,Bogleheads,18gvn13,/r/Bogleheads/comments/18gvn13/why_is_1x_leverage_so_common_amoung_bogleheads/kd3lxrg/

kd7qejs,"OK, did some reading and your comment about Kelly seems brilliant.

If you want to maximize net wealth \*on average\* then it seems you take on large leverage if possible. But this is kind of like the St Petersburg Paradox -- with large leverage the variance becomes huge and there's an intolerably large number of scenarios in which you go broke.

So instead you should maximize the average of the logarithm of wealth (which is  what, happiness??) thanks to Kelly's insight. This might give sensible values for the amount of leverage and would answer my question.

Most of us in Bogleheads would say something like: If you can meet your financial needs without leverage, why would you take on all that extra, un-needed risk? We generally are fans of taking on just enough risk to meet your needs, no more no less and once you've met your needs, to stop taking risk(s).

If you were important to me in my personal life, my recommendation would be something like this:

lm0twi0,"I think you are fundamentally misunderstanding what volatility drag is. A high volatility stock (think UPRO, which is 3x the S&P 500), will drag down your returns over time by the nature.  Look on the basic math behind expected returns - An expected return is the probability weighted basis from an investment or portfolio of securities. If you have 3x the returns, you will have 3x the losses - and 3x the losses means that if a stock drops 30%, you've lost over 90% of the underlying value.  It's also more expensive to maintain leverage - LETFs use credit swaps, futures, derivatives, and more expensive forms of leverage to maintain their daily 2x/3x equity exposure. 

Let's take a simple [backtest](https://testfol.io/?d=eJyNj8FKAzEQhl%2BlzMFThNSih4B4EU8iq%2FVSpCzjZrJG06RO0q2y7Ls7Nai3IuSQCV%2F%2B758R%2BpCeMTTIuMlgRsgFubQWC4GBM631qZ7LAQUU7c%2B7TJUbMICZC6UVoH1tfXQBi08RjMOQSUGH%2BcWFtAej%2F4bWMb1LzoqQw6ekcQrBx77d%2B2gP7IWeFGwTF5eCT1LsaYSIm4N78TFbnjTyx8eBcrn2g7dSTZjCOxEyyT4YO7qpjvudFKWqKb57I65x9S7Aslk9PlzdXi4E2BJ3FMv3TtNagWXspfmkfvXinp1r%2FX%2F%2FXYp0VH1Eu56%2BAA1iiLM%3D): What if I invested in 3x the S&P 500 during the worst time ever, say the start of, 2000? You had times where you achieved 70% rolling returns for years, and rolling returns of on average over 30-40% per year. You still under-performed the S&P 500 for almost three decades. If you started in 2010? Congrats, you doubled the S&P 500's returns - not 3x'ed. If you have a 50% loss, it takes a 100% return just to break even to where you were in the past. 

Why does the theory behind HFEA work? Because you are investing in two very leveraged assets that have a negative correlation to each other - with one risk and major assumption that was proven false - Inflation is a solved problem. Hedgefundie didn't forsee Covid, where we had significant inflation and falling equity prices - so the hedge of TLT leveraged at 3x fell in accordance to S&P leveraged at 3x. 

Second, I think you are misunderstanding leverage. 50% stocks does not mean you are leveraged at 50%. Leveraging at 100% is aggressive - that is, for every $1 the underlying index you have exposure to, you are borrowing $1. Retirees at 50% stock and 50% bonds have 0% leverage. 

There are multiple ways to use leverage to juice up returns. If you do a backtest of VT at 1.2x, there is [large boost compared to unleveraged](https://testfol.io/?d=eJyVkEFPwzAMhf%2FK5HNAXQ8cekMgBBJIoAECoakyjVMCXjLcrANV%2Fe94rWAbJ%2FAplp%2Ff%2B5wOao7PyNcouGig6KBJKKm0mAgKAAMU7E43TltkKKaZlgG0r6UPjjH5GKBwyA0ZqLB5cRzXUGTbpnRC7%2BrzSCj8qW4SmX2oy7UPdqM9ynoDyyjJRfZRcZ46CLjYZN%2FfmsldYGpJsCaryz601KRT33qrjCpOstJkIT0HQ0Vnv8KSr95IRtPxPdjOLq50uCSpKKThqn5uwGqKsvdmD%2BDyO34yPcw%2F%2Fs5ws9Jfo39h5EP2j%2BDkeHb%2BsCs4yPc45%2F0XtsmYsQ%3D%3D). You still are paying that margin rate (Right now, it's like 4.5% for a box spread) regardless if the equities go up or equities go down. If you saw a $500k loss in VT over the course of a few months, could you still pay $50k a year in margin interest? If you can and don't mind holding through the troughs (Remember, there was a decade where the S&P effectively returned zil, and you would be paying the interest rate the entire time), over the long time, leverage will have higher CAGR

What is common around here is products that leverage the bond side. Think NTSX/NTSI/ products. They invest in a 90/10 stock/cash ratio, and use the cash to leverage treasuries to get a 90/60 portfolio, or a 60/40 portfolio juiced up with 1.5x leverage. Or, RSSB, which takes VT (and a few /ES futures) and leverages up the bond portfolio for an equivalent 100/100 stock/bond ratio for a 2x leverage. They get increasingly expensive.  Personally, I wouldn't expose any of my retirement to that high of leverage on the equity side. I'm invested in both NTSX/RSSB as I think they are great ways to leverage up without exposing myself to as much risk on the equity side.  

Or, if you really think leverage is the best way, /ES gives around ~25x exposure. You can control ~270k worth of notional SPX exposure for an overnight maintenance of around 10k (depends on broker, volatility, etc).",1725747557,19,Bogleheads,1fbi6uc,/r/Bogleheads/comments/1fbi6uc/is_leverage_1x_good_and_if_so_whats_the_best_way/lm0twi0/

lm1n9nz,"daily reset leverage is crazy town. what you call letf.. but the etf isn't the interesting part.. nor really is the leverage.. it's the daily reset. the leverage is also not free just because you don't see the margin charge, it comes out of the NAV. (and not as part of the ER either).  It's never free to use other people's money.

bh is all about buy and hold.. so the right leverage is probably simply a loan. But now you have a floating hurdle rate - and to really buy and hold you need to keep that leverage constant despite what the rate floats to.. if you're going to lever up when rates are down (and vice versa) you're just timing the market.

I think if you really zoom out this can work. Equity returns are going to be more than the drag of the loan capital (that is the nature of capitalism after all), but you gotta play a very long game and you also have to massively keep leverage down to a dull roar because of the old margin call. When you're levered you can get called - and when you get called you sell when you're down.. you've just really screwed up your buy and hold. And sometimes you go down - that's what volatility is.

The more levered the less volatility it takes to get called - then you're done.

[His premise was that inflation was a solved problem](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4428688#p4428688). Unfortunately, that did not prove true.

lm5s7mk,"The justification for duration risk is fairly obvious.  Duration is literally a measure of price sensitivity, so higher duration inherently means more volatility.  And more volatility in a way that is inherently correlated to everything else that's sensitive to interest rates, so you can't diversify it away.  

Likewise, market risk / equity beta is a measure of the residual volatility left over after you diversify to the maximum extent possible within equities.  Any idiosyncratic volatility essentially disappears when you hold the entire market, so the portfolio you're left with has the volatility and return characteristics of ""the market"".  And in theory the individual stocks that make up the market should be priced according to how much they contribute to the volatility of that market portfolio, which is measured by their beta.  Stocks that contribute more of that volatility should be priced lower as compensation for that higher risk, otherwise people would just underweight those stocks for a free reduction of risk.  

But the size and value factors can't be explained by volatility.  If it were purely the volatility of small stocks and low multiple stocks that made them risky, then that volatility would either contribute to a higher beta (in which case they would have more compensated risk, but it would be beta not a new factor) or would be diversified away when you hold the market portfolio.  The CAPM is perfectly capable of pricing a category of stock that simply has high volatility.  

But we *do* see that small and value stocks have these anomalously high returns, or at least do in some datasets.  When you see that you could conclude that there's some other risk factor, and these high returns are just compensating that new risk factor.  That's typically the most common view among academics, though when trying to nail down what exactly that risk is ends up being more difficult.  Or you could say that these anomalously high returns are just mispricing.  After all, it's impossible to tell the difference between an error in market efficiency and an error in your asset pricing theory.",1725822491,3,Bogleheads,1fbi6uc,/r/Bogleheads/comments/1fbi6uc/is_leverage_1x_good_and_if_so_whats_the_best_way/lm5s7mk/

Not to mention, the next future drawdown could be worse - it could be -99% or more - and we don’t know if funds like this will even stay open in a crash like that. The AUM could theoretically get so low that the fund providers are prompted to liquify them. There was even a moment not long ago that the SEC was looking at restricting them which could have screwed retail investors with large holdings.

Roughly.  Complicated by the fact that the risk free rate itself isn't actually a known quantity.  Also an inverted yield curve is not great for the strategy since you can borrow at rates higher than you get from the bonds.  Though it's also a signal that the market thinks rates are lowering soon, which would certainly help the bond returns.

> There could still be a benefit if bonds are negatively correlated to stocks, but if they are positively correlated at all, it seems like the bond leverage in NTSX would only be a drag on the portfolio.

Why would the correlation have to be negative?  I mean that would be nice, and there's some reason to suggest it's true during big downturns, but it shouldn't be a necessary condition.

I have read that something healthier like 1.1x - 1.5x can be good for young’uns since they can recover losses easier as they are early in their investing career. To do this you’d prob just buy SPY shares on margin to the correct amount and hold long term, paying the interest on borrowing.

lahgcyy,"With triple leveraged ETF's timing matters A LOT. The usual leveraged ETF's that people usually look at, like SPXL or TQQQ, does not have enough price history to really show this.

You can do a backtest of how a hypothetical 3x leveraged ETF would have done based on historical prices. We can do this with S&P500 prices and dividends assuming a 1% expense ratio. Let's say that you invest on 02.01.2007. That's not a great starting point, but not the absolute worst either. After 1 year both the regular S&P and the 3x leveraged ETF would both be roughly at breakeven from your starting price.

Now if you go 2 years forward, the 3x ETF would be down 84%, compared to 34% for the S&P 500. How long would it take to recover from this? The S&P500 would be back to the 2007 price in 2012, while the 3x ETF would have taken until 2014 to break even again. To earn a 20% on the 3x ETF, you would have to wait until late 2016. Meanwhile the S&P500 would now be up 75% with dividends reinvested.

How long would it take for the 3x ETF to beat the S&P500 in this timeframe? It would have for brief periods in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Sustained outperformance would not be achieved until 2021 however (see the linked graph, with both the S&P500 and the 3x ETF reindexed to 100 in January 2007)

By investing in a regular diversified index, you will normally recover if you have an investment horizon of at least 10 years. Timing is not important with an investment horizon of multiple decade in this scenario, even if you buy at the absolute peak.

3x leveraged ETF's will outperform in theory as long as markets keep going up. And most of the time that is not an unreasonable expectation. But if you are unlucky, and buying today is like buying in early 2007, in 2 years time you would be down 84%.

m0pusz0,"I just did some Excel-ing on $100 invested at admittedly the worst possible time (January of 2000). The worst environment for something like SPXL is a market that is just bobbing up and down but not increasing which is exactly what was happening from 2000 to 2008. SPXL saw a max drawdown of more than 99% in that time (in March of 2009). To this day, it would not have recovered even after these explosive years. In fact, it is rarely worth more than 10% of the value of VOO at the same time. The total value of $100 of S&P shares after those 24 years is $414.43 which is not great. The total value of SPXL after the same interval is $39.43.

It is hard to get a feel for just how brutal volitility drag (along with a 1% expense ratio) is because we don't have data on SPXL or TQQQ dating back long enough. However, you can pull S&P500 data and set up a spreadsheet to mimic the behavior of SPXL over an extended period. The last decade has not been normal. It is tempting to look at it and think that you just need to weather a bad year or two and then watch your portfolio explode. 

Dollar cost averaging (along with not starting at the worst time in the history of the market) would alleviate a lot of that and may prove to be worthwhile. I haven't done more math than that. Your idea of either pick up 30% or lose 30% is valid if you can stand losing 30% of your money.

hic1ot2,"Here's my issue with HFEA: The cost of leverage. By that I do not mean the cliché ""leveraged ETF decay,"" which is not really as much of an issue as it's made out to be. I mean, literally, the interest rate you pay for leverage. The whole thing is predicated on the fact that LIBOR, which determines margin rates on manual leverage, and therefore the associated expense ratios of the 3x ETFs, won't go up. News flash: There is *nothing* protecting an investor from LIBOR or expense ratios on these ETFs from going up. Now, if you could sign a document on your margin loans that say ""I get this rate for an indefinite amount of time, no matter what,"" then great, but nobody has that deal. Margin rates, and therefore the expense ratios for the leveraged etf's that run on margin, are *totally* subject to debt rate changes over time.

TL;DR If you're going with a levered strategy, you are *betting* that interest rates will not move against you and make your leverage too expensive to maintain. If you think margin rates and therefore expense ratios are set in stone, you are gravely mistaken. These are not 30 year fixed mortgages.

The frustrating part here is there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of transparency on that point, either. To me, investors should know *exactly* the relationship between rates and expense ratios.

It's one of those actually-really-important points that gets totally ignored by both providers and customers, because no one wants to turn their attention to what they're not paying attention to.

And when the business is basically ""let's sell this thing to as many people as possible"" (terrible way to structure investments, which bogle was vehemently against, and would be turning in his grave if he saw what his own company was doing now), you're not exactly inclined to provide information that would cause investors to flee or reconsider using your etf.",1635435702,3,Bogleheads,qh9ope,/r/Bogleheads/comments/qh9ope/hedgefundies_excellent_adventure_on_bogleheads/hie5lmx/

""How it did"" has nothing to do with the cost of margin. That is passed on to the investor in the form of an expense ratio.

jopys3e,"Leveraged investing as a general matter is an acceptable idea for a young person. Millions of people do it (albeit unwittingly) by taking out a large mortgage on their home purchase. Balance sheets don’t care about the reason you wanted the debt - your investments are leveraged regardless. Others access the benefits of leverage by investing in companies that are themselves highly leveraged.

However, leveraged ETFs are a TERRIBLE idea for a long-term buy and hold investor because they reset leverage daily, and the short of why that’s important is that they deliver the 2x or 3x index return on a daily basis, but not on a long term basis due to volatility decay. So if the S&P returns 10% annually over 10 years, a 2x leveraged ETF will not return 2x that amount or even close to it, most likely. And in exchange, the downside risk can be astronomical and negatively life altering if you hit a bad market run.

Leverage always seems like a cheat code to success, but really it’s mostly a way for naive and inexperienced investors to get hammered into the reality that their risk tolerance isn’t what they once believed. Stay in the normal lanes - keep your leverage to a modest amount in a safe loan structure like a mortgage.",1687192188,20,Bogleheads,14dg1hs,/r/Bogleheads/comments/14dg1hs/why_not_spxl_instead_of_voo/jopys3e/

kc58o8z,"The best investment for your specific investment timeline is unknown when you invest, but will only be known in retrospect / hindsight. Therefore, when trying to figure out how to construct your portfolio, you shouldn't be trying to make the best / optimal portfolio, but a reasonable one that you're going to be able to maintain course on. A suboptimal (but reasonable) [plan](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Investment_policy_statement) that you're able to stick with is almost always going to outperform an optimal (again, only known looking back, not when you're investing) one that an investor deviates from. Boglehead investing should be boring.

[Behavioral mistakes](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Behavioral_pitfalls) (including performance chasing, which this question is) are often the most costly ones an investor can make, and are a good way for you to end up behind someone who follows a more simple standard [Three-Fund Portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio). If you're truly looking to expand a bit beyond the basic three-fund portfolio, the typical next logical step would be to consider [factor investing](https://www.pwlcapital.com/five-factor-investing-with-etfs/), which is based on academic research that certain ""factors"" that have historically given a return ""premium"" for investors (the authors won a Nobel Prize for their research, if that lends any credibility). The issue with factor investing is that it is not guaranteed in all investment timelines, and there could be long periods where your allocation underperforms a basic portfolio. You need to fully understand / agree with the research, and be willing to handle an underperforming portfolio for decades, because the worst thing you can do is give up on the position before the ""premium"" that you were hoping to see shows up. To successfully benefit from factor investing, it needs to be a lifelong commitment.

I believe diversification is the best way to maximize returns for the level of risk that I take with my investments. Adding additional exposure to things like SPXL / TQQQ, which include stocks that are already a large part of a globally diversified portfolio (e.g., VT / VTWAX) isn't adding diversification, but instead, concentration.

Can you backtest to a market condition where the CAPE ratio was high, inflation was high, and bond yields were low?

How would it affect leveraged funds if interest rates went back up to their highest levels (eg 15%+) since the funds rely on debt?

hufbj7z,"*In general* this will be true, and using leverage on a more conservative portfolio with better risk adjusted return than 100% equities so that you increase its risk to the desired level isn’t a new strategy. (Probably most popular iteration of this in the US is NTSX, which is effectively a 90/60 portfolio)

However just because equities and treasuries are frequently negatively correlated and usually no worse than uncorrelated doesn’t mean that there aren’t periods in which they happen to be highly positively correlated. Whenever designing a portfolio with leverage you really need to be prepared to handle the maximum possible downturn, not just the worst expected downturn for your investment timeline.

Investing is frequently referred to as “the loser’s game” for a reason. To win you just need to get decent returns and avoid losing long enough. Leverage increases your odds of losing even if it speeds up the process of winning. While I haven’t looked at your specific situation in detail, I would personally never recommend above 50% leverage (and only then with caution). 100% / 2x is a lot of leverage to try to pull off.",1643281871,6,Bogleheads,sdt0rd,/r/Bogleheads/comments/sdt0rd/about_to_go_2x_leverage/hufbj7z/

The main problem is that the risks that would cause the HEA strategy to underperform or fail are impossible to quantify because they are apt to be things we have rarely if ever seen before or cannot anticipate. But what we HAVE seen is that occasionally in the past, use of leverage has gotten many investors into trouble - notably ruining many investors in 1929 and destroying established investment banks in 2008. I treat every foolproof plan to beat the market using leverage with extreme caution - that is an overarching philosophy and a psychological choice. Call me risk averse if that makes it clearer.

The other issue is that I am on track to retire about 10 years with market returns as it stands. And I may not even retire then because I like my job. So I do not need to take these risks to achieve my goals.

hozsmw4,"""Are you purposely being dense or are you really this bad at stats?""

I could ask the exact same thing.

I am speaking on a risk adjusted basis. I am trying to point out that you do not get the returns on a 3X leveraged fund that you would expect because it tracks that 3X point on a daily basis. There is decay involved in holding these long term. This is well documented and why funds that use leverage have to have a disclaimer to go along with owning them.

""And you measured it via CAGR. That's not what it means to say that ""TQQQ is 257% of the returns of QQQ from 2010"".""

That is exactly what it is. CAGR is the yearly (one year, not multiple) average. CAGR is not the 10+ year return, so you cannot compare dollar values of each holding over a 10+ year time frame to each other as they aren't comparing the same thing when comparing against 3X.

55.29% per one year average versus 21.50% one year average. 55.29/21.50 = 2.57.

Using your logic of comparing just dollar amounts, I could find an example where one fund returning 10% per year on average (A) versus another that returns 7% per year on average (B) where the 10% fund will have 3X the returns if you give me a long enough time frame (its 40 years, by the way).

Would you classify a fund (A) that returned 302% the dollar amount of the other fund (B) over 40 years a 3X fund, but yet over 20 years only returned 174%?

(B) 1.07\^40 = 14.9745

(A) 1.10\^40 = 45.2593

45.2593/14.9745 = 3.02 or 302%

(B) 1.07\^20 = 3.8697

(A) 1.10\^20 = 6.7275

6.7275/3.8697 = 1.74 or 174%

&#x200B;

""TQQQ is maybe a shit idea because of behavioral risks of premature selling -- risks that are exacerbated in bear markets. Not because the returns aren't great or that they are more ""risky"" in a purely mathematical sense.""

This, I of course agree with. I haven't seen any simulation done, but during the dotcom crash I would think an investment of $10,000 at its peak to lowest point in a fund like TQQQ would be worth something like $200 to $500. Would take someone with an extremely strong will to hold during that.

j323rx7,"At a high level you're right - we are invested because we think that over the long run the market will go up. At it's heart, leverage is just a way of investing more into that same theory of operations. That's good. Juicing the S&P 500 is way more boglehead than holding ARKK.

The problem is that leverage, or using OPM (Other People's Money), is not free. Whether you are just taking it as margin, whether the ETF is borrowing it, or whether options are being used for leverage (a thing levered ETFs do) - it's all OPM and it all has a floating rate cost at its heart. That cost - and the correlation of when rates are high compared to the returns on those dates - are going to really impact your returns.

While I'm confident VOO over the long run will have a positive return, its less obvious that it will have a positive return after carrying costs of borrowing money to invest in it (much less a better return than pure VOO). If you're going to get in and out of leverage as rates fluctuate then you have market timing issues.. in the end that's what got me out of levered investing - I was levering up and down according to the cost of capital and wasn't really a buy and hold investor anymore even though I was buying the boringest securities (total market funds).

If you do go down that road you're better off taking margin and holding long term positions rather than using daily reset leverage like the fund you indicated. daily resets have a way of locking in down days (in order to get back to their 2x or 3x lever every night) on you.. if you want to be invested 2x, just borrow the money and be invested 2x for the long term.",1672931612,14,Bogleheads,103zzb9,/r/Bogleheads/comments/103zzb9/thoughts_on_spxl/j323rx7/

gw5eqy3,"imo 2x is far better than 3x when it comes to broad market etfs or bonds, because 3x has the potential to never recover from a recession, even doing the blended UPRO/TMF strategy.

If it only makes 2% more that doesn't really make it worth it.  The strategy shines when it comes to re-balancing.  Eg, 80/20 SSO/UBT for the first 5 years from the bottom, then 50/50, then every year after that +10 to bonds, so 40/60, 30/70, ...  When either side is more extreme you have the potential to make more when rebalancing.  The downside is you have to have one hell of a stomach.  Eg, if you buy 100% SSO during a recession and a black swan event happens, like a country declares war on the US or something and a double recession happens (which would be the first of its kind.  It literally has never happened before.) then it would not be unheard of to have a 90% drop.  At that point you *really* do not want to sell.  So you're making yourself vulnerable to your emotions during a black swan event.  On the other end you're profiting from such a strategy.

There are other strategies too.  Eg, say you own 2/3rds of your account in SSO and the rest in cash.  If your broker has a cash buyback program you'll probably get enough to pay off the fee from SSO and then some, so you'll make money when the market goes flat, yet when the market goes up you'll make a bit more than holding VOO.  On the other end it will drop more when it does.  By choosing what percent you want in SSO to cash you can determine the volatility.  Eg, holding 50% SSO and 50% cash with a buyback program is better than holding 100% VOO.",1619597382,10,Bogleheads,n081fi,/r/Bogleheads/comments/n081fi/leveraged_a_bit_rather_than_a_lot/gw5eqy3/

gw7ym2n,"Hi - I don't typically use reddit, but I created this account just now to help give you an answer. Apologies for the long response, I tend to be verbose

A few months I had basically the same question you did - what's the optimal down payment rate for a house to pay in order to maximize investment growth? Should I pay 5% down and invest a larger amount up front in lieu of a larger down payment, or should I pay 20% down and invest the monthly saving in mortgage payments each month?

I do data science type work for my day job, so in order to answer my question I created a historical simulation using [Shiller's stock market data going back to 1871](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm); the code backtests two different strategies for every 30 year period between 1871 and 2020, then summarizes the number and magnitude of wins for each strategy

Once the system was programmed, I plugged in 20% and 5% down payments as well as their corresponding monthly mortgages derived from Google's built in mortgage payment calculator.

The code output showed that a 20% down payment beat the 5% down payment around 95% of the time, and when it did win it typically won by a lot more than when the 5% option won

I repeated the same methodology with 20% vs 10%, 15%, and 30%. 20% won in all cases, though 15% was nearly 50/50, and 10% and 30% performed much better than 5% did

I also compared a 15 year mortgage vs a 30 year mortgage, and found that the 30 year won around 80%-90% of the time

The overarching lesson is that you should invest early and you should invest often - 20% beats 5% because 20% allows for continuous monthly investments; 30 year beats 15 year because 30 year allows for investments much earlier than 15 year.

Note that this is all a result of today's very low interest rates - in decades past, it made more sense to pay off mortgages quicker because the rates were so high. And also note that the system isn't perfect - taxes aren't taken into account, nor did I build in a method to remove PMI payments once the owner has reached 20% equity

If there's sufficient interest, I can see about optimizing and publishing this simulation into a web app so you can plug in whatever down payment and interest rates.

gw88a67,"I’m glad it was useful for you

20% vs 30% - I didn’t investigate this too closely, but here’s my intuition: there’s always going to be a trade off between investing a large lump sum now (lower down payment) or giving yourself the ability to invest more continuously each month (lower mortgage rates). For whatever reason, 20% down seemed to come out of the better end of that trade off the majority of the time. 

I didn’t look into the threshold interest rate, but I think a good heuristic would be to view debts as a negative investment. Every dollar you put into your mortgage before you have to will have a guaranteed return - the interest it doesn’t accrue. If your interest rate is 3%, I would bet that the market could beat that investment. If your interest rate is closer to 15% or 20%, I’d be tempted to pay it off as soon as I could.",1619649183,3,Bogleheads,n081fi,/r/Bogleheads/comments/n081fi/leveraged_a_bit_rather_than_a_lot/gw88a67/
gw6r1eb,">I was more curious about the part of investing over paying down the mortgage early rather than the use of ""leverage"" in either scenario.

Gotcha.  There is always this: https://youtu.be/Uwl3-jBNEd4

The tl;dr of the topic is, if you can get a mortgage with an interest rate below 4% then it is generally considered wise to minimize paying the house and maximize putting into the stock market.  This is especially applicable now with sub 3% loans.  This is because the market beats price appreciation of owning a house.  The upside is you do get that leverage so you can put into the market and minimize paying off a house.  If at that point mortgage + tax + repairs are less than renting, a mortgage is better.  If renting is cheaper, which it is in most areas except LCOL areas even with the leverage, renting is typically better.  ymmv depending on the area you live in.  Some MCOL areas sometimes have better deals buying than renting and vice versa.  Ofc this is a general rule of thumb.  You can pay off the house in 30 years, rent increases over time, and you can sell the house off the profits you made, so there needs to be a tilt in housing's favor.  There are a lot of buy vs rent calculators out there that take this into account, but it doesn't give as strong of a tilt towards owning as one might initially assume which is why the general rule of thumb tends to work.",1619626540,2,Bogleheads,n081fi,/r/Bogleheads/comments/n081fi/leveraged_a_bit_rather_than_a_lot/gw6r1eb/

This does not incorporate expense ratios nor the cost of leverage which has become rather significant - the overnight lending rate is over 4% and the carry cost of a strategy like r/HFEA is up to 10% so even just a flat market can harm you. Leveraged funds close all the time because of decay or outflows. Below a certain AUM it’s no longer profitable for the fund provider to operate them, or the fund itself may run out of cash. Thus you are risking total loss of your investment.

If you are interested in using leverage, look up “[lifecycle investing](https://www.lifecycleinvesting.net/)” which suggests starting at 2x at a very young age and gradually working down to 1x before retirement. However, even the study that idea is based assumes a possibility of total loss early on in one’s investing timeline and realistically only a tiny fraction of investors would have the risk tolerance for that. You could also look at [Wisdom Tree’s Efficient Core funds](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/ntsx/) which use a more modest 1.5x, leveraging only treasuries using futures contracts.

Your counterparty in all of those trades has the option of a 4+% return on treasuries so they aren't going to let you use their cash for free - you need to offer more.

j4g8exk,"Levered ETFs trade short gamma.

Meaning they reset their leverage ratio every day.

Markets go up, leverage falls so they have to buy more to get back to target. 

Markets go down, leverage rises, so they have to sell to get back to target.

This is equivalent to buy high, sell low.

Leveraged ETF’s are doomed to drop to zero in the long run unless the market consistently trends higher without any volatility. If you have a lot of up/ down vol with zero trend, or if markets go down you’ll get hosed.

You need to run your own leverage, even then 3X is too much, using a broker and someone like Interactive Brokers has the best margin rates.

However the most successful leverage is on a non mark to market basis (meaning you don’t price your asset daily, and don’t have to stump up losses if the price falls) - it’s why people love real estate. It’s not that the return on the asset class is particularly remarkable, it’s that there’s a market out there for affordable non mark to market leverage out there. 

The other way is owning your own life insurer - it’s worked out pretty well for Buffet over the years. There’s an excellent paper out there saying “yeah buffet is good at value, but it’s his non MTM leverage in Berkshire that’s driven most of his returns”…

Anyways. 3X is too much on stocks. I’d probably only get comfortable with 3X on a short duration treasury fund…

Because most of the big boys in investing are saying we should expect something like 3-6% real returns going forward for stocks and bonds are even worse, around 1-3% real returns… which basically amount to needing to double your or even triple your savings rate to reach the same goals as our parents did. So people are just incapable of saving more due to various factors like low wages or children. 

But I’m not necessarily advocating for leveraged investments. But it’s a important note that the lifecycle investment guide uses options not leveraged funds. The only reason to use LETFs is if you need leverage but don’t have enough capital to buy options.
