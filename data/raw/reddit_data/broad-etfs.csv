Broad,Investing,1odfers,Question to all the investors,nkufaka,"Penny stocks are absolute garbage.  I used to dabble in them but quit after I found out what they really are.  They are nothing but printing presses for dirt bags to sell shares of worthless companies.  Real companies like Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, etc. were never penny stocks. So don't fall for that. Real companies go public with a real IPO supported on Wall Street.  Penny stock companies do back door filings or shell takeovers to go public.  Stay away from them.  Back when these companies first went online on the web for the first time in the 1990s, many of them went from pennies to over $100.  But all of this buying was met by selling at the end.  Those stock prices plunged back or close to zero once reality set in that they are worthless. This proved the true motive of these companies and their promoters.  Penny stocks are worthless companies.  Your odds playing games at a casino are by far better than penny stocks.  Stay away.

Any other setup should be compared to that and only done if you have a strong reason to do so. You had a strong reason, it paid off, and now you dont have a strong reason to continue.

I would probably roll the entire thing into a bit of voo and some bonds etfs if you dont have any of those. Seriously most people should have some kind of bond ladder going even if its small. When a market downturn happens those bonds are usually a golden ticket while the rest of your portfolio is in the dumps. 

We can debate how much of your portfolio should be in that kind of stuff, but having none of it is usually betting everything will work out really well. The reality is that there will always be a downturn coming. It could be months, years, or decades away, but when it happens equities usually suffer a great deal for a period of time. If that bad period runs long and happens during the beginning of your retirement it will be ugly.

I am selling as much former employer stock as I can without jacking my long term capital gains taxes through the roof. You’ll have to pick your number, 15%, 18.8% or 23.8% and fill out that tax bracket. For me, it is 18.8 but sometimes I think this is going to take too long and my efforts will be eclipsed my market gains. Do take a look at state tax treatment for LTCG. Here in California, the state tax bracket is 9.3% out to nearly $700k, which is around the start of the 23.8% federal bracket, but if I push harder, not only will I get 5% extra federal, but another 4% California tax lumped on for a total of 37.1%, plus some extra bonus millionaire assessments to support mental health and such. 

NVIIDA has way, way more exposure to AI than Apple, so I’d start there. Apple won’t be immune because it is in the same ETFs with the AI majors, but should bounce eventually when sanity returns. NVIDIA just needs some competition or a large pullback in spending and it is sunk, a shadow of itself and will stay that way for a while, probably through the next crash, or so I believe. That said, long term, Apple needs to recommit to engineering or suffer decline.

If you are holding some losers - tough in this market -  then you can sell those too and use those losses to cancel some of the gains for tax purposes. See Tax Loss Harvesting.

Your broker is probably also running a stock exchange program. They take your stock and a bunch of other investors stock, toss it together into a mini-fund, make you wait 7 years for tax magic to occur, then you get back a bunch of stock from the other companies in the fund, and a little of your own. This will not spark capital gains tax (yet) but at the end of the day, you will be left holding a pile of different single stocks rather than just NVidia. What is this pile of tripe they give you? Well it is all the stuff that other people had too much of and didn’t want — GE! Yay! — but at least you are diversified some.  There is a big difference between this and an actual ETF, which can trade in kind with every stock in the market and keep itself current. You are still owning a bunch of single stocks which over the decades will one by one go dark due to age and mismanagement with no tax efficient way to replace them with new stuff.

My plan, if I make it that far, is to probably use bonds for income with a part of my investments, but only what i actually need to be spending, but keep some in dividend paying index trackers so a part of my pot hopefully continues to grow whilst bringing in albeit less income. 


It's more complex than that, but thats generally the idea. 


There are even companies which offer a fund which is based on the year you plan to retire who, as that time approaches, begin to move the funds access towards income, so you don't have to do anything.

Part of the reason to do this is advance of retirement is to lower the risk (if the bubble burst and the market suddenly moves down 40% then you're massively affected right now, but, of course, if you'd been selling off both of these over the last 5 years then you'd have made a lot less money so..)

The other reason is tax, to make sure you're not suddenly selling a million dollars worth of shares and losing however much to the tax man.

Given the figures involved it wouldn't be a bad idea to take professional advice, but make sure it's something you pay at the time, not as a % of your portfolio going forward!

Well done on holding for so long, I.got into NVIDIA at $20 a share and was happy to see a 100% gain, at which point I sold.. seems odd that one of my biggest regrets investment wise is a 100%+ profit, but there you go, but this is exactly why you are sitting on such a big sum right now, and I'm not, you just kept holding and ran your own race..

If you sell it, the government is taking 20% or maybe 40% if the LTCG tax treatment reverts to income. So, you want a self renewing asset that stays current with the market, A ETF will do that. Single bonds or single stocks will not. You do have a lot of funds here, so that is great. How much dividend vs. how much growth is a matter of tuning. More dividend than you need is just tax drag. Too little dividend isn’t a huge problem and lets you selectively sell off the stuff that needs selling either because it underperforms or rebalancing.

It is often helpful in retirement to pretend to be poor or very poor, to take advantage of progressive tax rates and things like ACA subsidy. Dividends will prevent that.

Congratulations on your retirement u/Johnny-Virgil! With nearly half your wealth in two names, your financial future still hinges on company-specific risk. A few strategies to consider:

**Exchange funds** – Contribute appreciated stock (like NVDA or AAPL) into a diversified pool without triggering capital gains. A 7-year hold, but highly effective if you don’t need liquidity soon.

**Gradual diversification** – Dollar cost average out of your stock over time while optimizing tax brackets. Reinvest proceeds in liquid ETFs or a direct indexing portfolio to maintain flexibility.

**Protective hedging** – Use collars to limit downside while retaining some upside potential. Can be used to straddle tax years if you are waiting to drop into a lower tax bracket in 2026.

**\*Tax-aware long/short** – Enhanced version of direct indexing (eg 130/30). Uses margin borrowing and short sales to accelerate loss harvesting, allows you to offset gains from selling your concentrated stocks. \*this one is a bit more aggressive and may not be appropriate for your portfolio and stage in life, but I'm including for general awareness in this thread. Please discuss with your financial advisor.

A blend of two or more of these strategies could provide immediate diversification, continued upside potential, sufficient liquidity, and tax efficiency.

My personal view is that Apple/Nvidia are going to be substantially more volatile than other parts of the market, but will likely perform well over the midterm. I would personally probably tolerate the added risk for sake of tax efficiency, especially if I was in a position of not having to sell if there was a 2-3 year downturn.

Another thought — I’m not sure what you said you were holding in your tax sheltered account, but if a decent amount of it is in an S&P 500 type fund, it has an outsized holding in big tech. You can also diversify by moving some of that into a diversified fund which isn’t highly overweight big tech, which is a completely tax free way to add more sector diversity.

Broad,Investing,1o2mnm4,Suppose we're not in an AI Bubble,niq3oru,"Agreed - if this supposed bubble were to pop, the bogleheads who've been holding VT since before covid (let's say) will ultimately have made less money than those who've held pure growth (let's say VGT and SMH), in the event tech drops ~40% and VT drops ~15-20% or whatever. Similar to what happened April 2025.

Combined with the correlative nature of the global market, the tech growth over the past few years has (and I believe will continue to) exceed the value from an overly diluted portfolio that will also drop precipitously, but just not as much.

Maybe I'm naive, but for this reason I think mitigating downside risk is less valuable than most people realize than remaining exposed to outsized upside potential.

Risk. As you get older, and in all cases when your investment horizon is getting closer, investing is as much about not getting kicked in the teeth as it is about returns.

Volatility.  As you approach and enter retirement volatility becomes a major factor.  Once you start to make withdraws the math that makes dollar cost averaging so helpful when you are young reverses and becomes a major drag on the portfolio.  In a bear market it even has a name, Sequence of Returns Risk.

Everybody looks smart in a bull market, specially those who have never been through a long, deep bear market.  Don’t fall for that trap.  Ask yourself how your investment would have done 2000 - 2010.  Think how about how your parents would have fared retiring in 1999.  My personal rule is to always be ready for a 40% market correction that takes 8 years to recover — easy for you now, much harder as you enter retirement.  Bonus points for thinking about the 1972-1982 scenario!

William Sharpe called living off a portfolio “…the nastiest, hardest problem in finance.”. He does not have a YouTube channel, but he does have a Nobel Prize and is rather well known in the fields of economics and finance.

If you want to get a grip on retirement planning for older people I suggest books by Wade Pfau (who is well qualified and has written a great deal on the subject) and Michael McClung’s *Living Off Your Money*.

Finally, be very cautious when it comes to getting involved in family member’s finances.  Very, very cautious.",1760096513.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o2ctn5/should_my_parents_investments_have_doubled_over/nir8s26/

Broad,Investing,1nzggcq,VOO and chill in retirement,ni71t20,"I'm 99% in equities and been retired for 13 years, and I'm doing it wrong?

When my portfolio is at least 250% of what it was when I retired?

For the VOO example, the withdrawal rate is 4.8%. With 3% inflation, that equates to a 7.8% break even rate. That's on the high side.

However, your example does not factor in distributions. VOO distributions would be in the 1.25% range, so on a $1 MM portfolio what would be about $12,500, so you would only be selling $35,500 in shares.

Here's the approach I recommend. Google Javier Estrada 90 10 and read his research on 90% equities, 10% cash equivalents. It's based on a Warren Buffett suggestion from 2013. I have followed the equities and cash approach since my retirement in 2012, and it has worked extremely fine.

And the more money you have, your withdrawal level becomes a lower percentage, assuming the same level of expenses. And the way you get more assets is buying holding as large of percentage of stocks as feasible, with some cash when there is a market hiccup.

And yes, selling shares is fine too. I have done so repeatedly.

The other way in a retirment account is to move money out of VOO and invest in a dividend ETF like QQQI 13% yield, or SpYI 11%yield.  these payout monthly.  So about 500K in SPYI would generate about 4K a month of income without selling any shares.  And If you don't spend all that money in a month reinvest it.  

The issues with selling stock is sometimes you end up selling at a loss for income.  This can lead to sequence of return risk.  Without sequence of return risk you will generally run out of money after about 30 years.  With sequence of return risk you could run out of money a lot less time.  

With dividend you are never selling shares.  Some dividend investments have been paying a dividend for 100s.  Some mutual funds and CEFs have been paying out for many decades.  ETFs are relatively new but the older have been paying outdoor just over 30 years. As long as you invest in fund or company that swell managed you would have money for life.

They are not the same; VT adds every other country in the world. 

> I need to diversify my investments in this account and was looking for suggestions on how to do that? Add bonds or other ETFs? 

First, you should be diversifying across portfolios, not accounts: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Asset_allocation_in_multiple_accounts

Second, it would be helpful if you had a goal for your diversification. Why do you feel the need to diversify, specifically? 

Thirdly, in general bonds are a common next asset class, and BND is a common way to do that. You could also get a target date fund or lifecycle fund instead of DIYing this. If you answer the previous question, we could give more targeted advice.",1759614894.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ny5ssg/how_to_diversify_investments/nhshsqx/

Broad,Investing,1ny5ssg,How to diversify investments,nhx3rq9,"Fund-wise,VT contains most of the world’s investable stocks, while VTI is only US based ones.  Hasn’t been a bad bet as Fidelity released a study that 70% US stock/30% non-US was the optimal mix from 1950 to 2022 (reducing volatility, tho pure U.S. returned a wee bit more), .. but the past is no guarantee of the future as they say.   

There’s diversifying bonds, with long Treasuries being the least correlated with stocks as in a recessionary downturn = investment grade bonds will go up while stocks go down.   However if rates rise both stocks and bonds can get hit like 2022.  However since 1900-ish, stocks have returned 10% per yr on average vs bonds at 5%,  .. so it’s advised that younger people go with more stock.   

There’s some gold and/or commodity funds to look at.  Bill Bernstein, a neurologist turned fund adviser made a point of recommending a little bit in “gold” and a little bit in long Treasuries to take insure against extremes in the economy (maybe more for psychological salve, but more sanity is always a plus).  Anyways I add these to the “3-fund portfolio” (4-fund with BNDX) .. with an example in whitecoatinvestors “150 portfolio ideas better than yours” webpage // right below their 3-fund “boglehead” portfolio description.  

Think one needs to be careful once getting past 3 or 4 funds, which is why the whitecoat investors site limits a 3 “plus” fund portfolio’s alternative funds to 10% or less.

Broad,Investing,1ny5ssg,How to diversify investments,ni8tr6y,"Lifecycle funds are target date funds that don't change their allocation over time: they just stay 80% stocks 20% bonds, or whatever the number is, forever. BND is a popular vanguard fund that tries to emulate the entire US bond market. 

Continuing with vanguard TDFs in your other accounts would be a very reasonable option, and simple. Although, they aren't really designed for taxable accounts and can occasionally produce unexpected tax bills there. The complicated option is https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-efficient_fund_placement , but personally even as someone who likes complicated things that's too much, and I just shove everything in the taxable account into the equivalent of VTI and VXUS. (There's a minor tax benefit to splitting them up, but you could just do VT instead.)

That is assuming you're contributing enough to [max out all tax-advantaged accounts](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Prioritizing_investments). If not, just do the TDFs you've got and don't worry about it.

Have a written financial plan.  It does not have to be long, and it should not be carved in stone -- in fact it should be revised often.

A bedrock principle of your plan should be the realization that a long, deep market correction can occur at any time [I use 40% down and 8 years to recover, you pick your own numbers].  As can a long, deep recession.  So plan accordingly.  And realize that corrections and recessions often come hand in hand.

Retirement savings?  At age 21 a long and deep correction is a good thing, since you can buy in at lower valuations.

Emergency savings?  They need to be in something that will not be getting crushed in a market correction/recession.  So no stocks.  HYSA, money market or Treasury bills are the tools for that.  The general rule is 6 months of expenses, but I suggest 6 months of expenses PLUS moving costs.  Being able to relocate during a recession can be crtical.

Saving for something 10 years or so in the future, such as a house downpayment?  Learn about a thing called ""asset allocation"".

if you look at the dot com, cisco had a forward PE of over 180, but know NVDA has a forward PE of about 25. how can that be a bubble. now the biggest companies in the index are hugely more profitable than what the dot com bubble were. then they would very often raise cash through debt in order to make investments, now they are using cashflow, because yes, they have a shit ton of money, and on top of that they are buying back stock at the biggest levels ever in history. how can that be a bubble. the are companies here and there wich are both pricy, overvalued and their ROI can't be seen or estimated, and could fail, that is true. but they won't even matter considering their size. so ignore. we are in a decade long process of building the AI infrastructre, and we are probably in the second or third year of that. standing on the sidelines and looking at that could have very negative impact on performance. that doesn't mean you can't take defensive measures, like buying puts when it feels bubbly, or keeping a bigger pile of cash if a downturn of 10-20% comes. but if the top companies will generate QoQ larder and larger profits and investments, gl with that bubble. i would follow NVDA religiously, listening to everything they say, follow the money, and if the day comes when NVDA puts out a CAGR of 20-30% then that is the top. or could signal one.

Broad,Investing,1nu2wv5,Are stocks overvalued and how to hedge against a recession?,ngznhfk,"Simple answer. If you think something is overvalued. You can sell instead of buying. So, you can make money from this decrease. Once you think the asset went back to it’s real value then you buy it back. We call it ‘shorting’.

Second option: if you think, something is overvalued and you think shorting is risky, you can pile cash and not buy. Keep the cash in 4.5 percent thing. Once the asset values goes back normal, then buy.

So, don’t make the stupid decision like “keep buying”. This is extremely wrong. Cash is the king or short.",1759232224.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nu2wv5/are_stocks_overvalued_and_how_to_hedge_against_a/ngznhfk/

VOO = long term growth, broader market exposure. Beats SCHD in a bull market anyday.
SCHD = long term consistent dividend payment, ""quality"" holdings. Safer, but at the cost of growth. Probably only beats VOO in bear market.

It's all about tax strategy. The idea of dividend investing is it pays you without having to sell the stock and deal with cap gains. (Better for retirement when you need a constant income). The idea of growth investing is that your investment grows, and you don't have to pay taxes on the dividends. (Better for when you have a long time until retirement). 

The problem with focusing on either/or is that you can blind yourself to opportunities.",1759194810.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ntzajp/in_investing_what_are_the_advantages_and/ngxj4c4/

In the past 10 years VOO gives about 290% return while SCHD gives 250%. Both numbers includes dividend reinvest. The real difference is slightly more in favor for VOO, assuming you didn't sell any, due to tax. 


I wouldn't call this different huge but it's significant. So for me, as long as I am OK with the higher volatility, I will go with VOO. This is generally true when you don't plan retirement soon.


Yes I understand past perf does not equal future perf. But for large blend ETF like VOO and SCHD, past 10yr perf is the best simple metric you can look at.

A strong structure requires a stout foundation. Before moving to higher levels of investing you need a solid Core portfolio. We are seeking diversity, long holding periods, outperformance and dependable income.

The strategy of the Core portfolio is designed to conserve your assets, build your wealth and reach your long term financial goals by beating inflation and generating above average income.

Once the Core is built you can move onto the next level Blue Chip Outperformers. Moving towards the pinnacle has more to do with focus and strength rather than risk.

In the world we currently live in where like 10 stocks make up more than a third of the S&P 500, market performance is VERY heavily tied to the performance of just a few companies.

The idea of the portfolio construction I was proposing was to capture those players using MGK but then for the REST of the portfolio, go all in on value + quality (SCHD and SCHY probably aren't the purest way to approximate that, but they do align with the idea).

Of course by doing that you create a  ""barbell"" that is heavy at the top ((MGK) and heavy at the ""bottom"" (SCHD + SCHY) (in terms of valuation multiples), so what gets left out here is the ""middle"" of the market (i.e. large (but not mega) and mid cap growth).

Broad,Investing,1nse5u1,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio",ngu6i0t,"I understand the point of a tilt.

The purpose of the thought experiment of this post is to suggest that the optimal firms to ""underweight or even exclude"" might NOT be mega cap growth.

It is possible that the dominance of the current crop of mega cap growth stocks in global ETFs indicates a structural shift in the nature of the way that firms operate in the economy, because these firms' characteristics (low need for capital to scale, reoccurring revenue streams with no or low additional capital investment, strong network effects, etc...) are different from the characteristics of firms that dominated the economy during the time periods in which the value premium has been observed.

However, it is also possible that the value premium still exists in OTHER segments of the market.

That's the premise behind the post.

Give the top growth firms a weighting similar to their index weighting to hedge the idea that they may have characteristics that make them structurally unlikely to mean revert but likely to continue dominating markets for a long term time period.

Then seek value in the rest of the portfolio but still keep a total geographic split similar to VT.

If you do that, what gets underweighted is NOT mega cap growth, but the firms ""in the middle"" so to speak.  The ones that aren't the giant growth names but also aren't the traditional value players.

But that’s just recency bias, it’s like saying the equity premium is dead because stocks trailed tbills over the past 10/15 years (which has happened multiple times in history).

Broad,Investing,1nse5u1,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio",ngunzyv,"It might be recency bias.

I agree that lower price relative to expected future cash flows will always indicate a value premium, but I think we both know that the way most funds try to measure value is usually not through a rigorous DCF calculation but rather by looking at multiples (like P/E, P/B, P/S, EBIT/EV etc...)

This usually works in aggregate, because growth rates tend to mean revert, or at least they have in the past as competition erodes competitive moats, so a higher multiple usually means that growth has been over forecasted.

I just think we have to acknowledge the possibility that this mean reversion effect might not exist for the current crop of mega cap growth firms.  Not just because of recency bias but because of fundamental differences in the way these firms' businesses operate as compared to how firms that have historically dominated the market have operated.

This might mean that both the ""easy"" multiple based approach for tracking ""value"" AND a traditional DCF (even multi stage), which usually assumes reversion to the mean in both growth and profitability over time, might underestimate intrinsic value for these kinds of firms.

I'm not saying this is 100% the case (in fact, I think it likely that it is NOT the case over a very long term time horizon).  

I'm just saying that if you isolate that segment of the market (represented by MGK here) and hold it in proportion to its weight in the market (where the market is represented by VT) you can effectively hedge this possibility while seeking a traditional value based approach in the rest of your portfolio.

I'm not personally currently operating my own portfolio this way, and I think it needs a lot more rigorous analysis before anyone should consider doing something like that.

I just think it's an interesting idea to ponder and based on my initial ""back of the napkin"" analysis that suggests the approach might have held some premium over the past decade might warrant further investigation to confirm or deny if it holds any value over the long term.",1759163113.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nse5u1/using_mgk_schd_and_schy_to_create_a_value_and/ngunzyv/

When I was growing up and had interest in when a 401k was first introduced to me at work, none of my coworkers wanted one, as they said ""why should i give away my money for future me? I want it today""

I mentioned that it's more like an emergency or safety vehicle for retirement but it was their decision not to.

Now it's been a good 20 years later and I wonder if they are all still confident it was the right decision. The thing is at some point you just have to let them handle their own destiny. Advice is fine, but if they don't want to take it then that is their choice too. Even my relatives, I don't push them to do anything, I encouraged my mother to consider a 401k as a backup even for her part time job when she was active and she agreed, and was fortunate to use it to help pay off her bills when she retired, saving a lot of stress for her later in life. It wasn't a huge amount, but it still took off the pressure since it got her debt to near zero.

Also keep in mind the market is very often near the highs, it isn't like some sort of passive dead fish year round, only during depressions. Despite the negatives, we don't spend a lot of time in downturns compared to all of the stock markets history.

When I started actively investing in 2018 I made mistakes by buying what was in front of me, what I saw, and what I knew. This was recommended by several sources as a starting point or strategy for beginners.

Well, that was the wrong way to go for me since all my picks nosedived after purchasing them. I then sold everything and started out from scratch investing in a small number of stocks instead of as many as I could. One of my biggest purchases was in the oil industry and then the pandemic occurred. I was purchasing like crazy when everyone else was selling and I rode that wave to the bottom and back up again. Now, my biggest lesson is to balance out my portfolio so I don't have a majority position in any one stock in my portfolio and paying off all my debt.

Broad,Investing,1nn2eed,Would you keep 40% of your portfolio in AMZN to avoid capital gains tax?,nfifv8g,"Sounds like you’re talking about RSUs. If you’re still vesting annually or quarterly, you are paying income tax and have cost basis at market value, so just start selling everything you vest immediately and you will owe no further taxes on those shares and be able to take that cash and put it into other things.

You may also still want to reduce your overall amzn position because 40% is an awful lot of eggs in one basket. Your oldest shares are long term capital gains but they also likely have the lowest cost basis, meaning there are more gains to tax. You may consider looking at your tax lots and selecting out those with the highest cost basis, as you may pay less overall tax on lots that have a higher cost basis, possibly even if they are subject to short term capital gains, but especially those with high cost basis and eligible for the long term tax treatment.

One other thought, coming from tech myself, I think it may seem like a great idea to ride there growth of your own company but you have a very concentrated risk considering you also work there. There’s a decent chance a deep dip in the share price would correspond with you also losing your job around the same time, since companies cut staff in times of trouble. Those would be two bad things to happen together. You also have an investment in the form of everything unvested, which tends to get topped up periodically to keep you invested. So you actually have much more than 40% of your future wealth invested if you think about it.

You can't pretend that capital gains tax doesn't exist because you pay that either way.

Roth and traditional 401k both have advantages and disadvantages. You have more capital growing with traditional because it's pretax. But it's good to have both contributions because you can take from that bucket in retirement to avoid getting into higher tax brackets. 

It's good to have both. But while you're young, it's better to allocate more to a Roth because you pay the tax while you're not making as much as you will later in your career. When you are later in your career, traditional is better because it is pretax, so will lower your taxable income, which will be higher later in your career. 

However, if you have the ability to contribute to a HSA account. Max that first. It's pretax going in, and tax-free going out if spent on medical, which will be a lot of your expenses when you are old in retirement. Even if you want to take non-medical withdrawals from it in retirement, it gets taxed like a traditional account, so no harm. You can invest the money in the account into stocks and funds just as you would with a 401k. So, ideally you just pay cash for medical bills before retirement and you just leave your HSA alone and treat it just as you would a 401k. Let it grow and take advantage of the double tax advantage in retirement, having never paid any tax on the income nor gains. 🫡",1757872949.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ngvf8i/i_just_found_out_about_a_roth_ira_since_it_is/ne7g53h/

The bad news is the 7000 per year limit.  But there are ways to get around the limit.

* You can move money from an existing 401K or other IRA to to Roth. you pay tax doing this but there is no limit on the ammount.
* You can invest in a dividend fund or stock inside the roth There is no limit on how much dividned income in the Roth.
* Neither of the above option change the 7000 a year deposit limit.
* Note there is a taxable income limit for roth accounts.  if you make too much money the 7000 a year depsit limit will drop to zero.

No you could take a bit of a risk early on in the roth and invest all of your Roth account in higher risk dividend funds.  Two I really like are QQQI 13% dividend yield or BTCI 25% dividend yield.  QQQI basically exceeded that long term average return of of the Nasdaq 100  and the S&P500 index funds.  There funds basically earn on average about 10%. BTCI basically exceeds the return  of most index funds.  Some like yieldmax funds (near 100% yield but these funds have significant NAV erosion so the share price drops every year and as a result the monthly dividend payout gets smaller every year.  But the yield stays about the same.  So I don't recomend them.

So take a high yield fund and add money to it every year until the Cash income from dividends exceeds 7000 per year.  At that point you can Turn off autmatic dividend reinvestment and start using the dividend  money to  buy other less risky funds.   Or you have a mix of dividend and growth index funds and maybe your fovorit individual stocks.

I personally prefer dividend investing over growth investing.  So my roth is mostly dividend funds with  one  growth fund.  My dividend funds currently generate 20K of dividend income a year in the Roth.   I was also late starting a Roth.  But I am also converting my 401K money to the Roth.  Unfortunately that plus my regular taxable invcomem eceeds the income limit so currently I cannot deposit 7000 a year into my roth.  But as my 401K drops over time that problem should eventually vanish.Curently I In my roth I have QQQI, ARDC,  EIC, PBDC, SCHD, SCHY, FAGIX for dividend income, With SCHG and for growth.  And will probably add  as money allows BTCI, SPYI, PFFA, EMO, CLOZ, UTF, UTG, and JAAA.  Goal is 100k a year of income from dividends.",1757873590.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ngvf8i/i_just_found_out_about_a_roth_ira_since_it_is/ne7iigt/

Broad,Investing,1nguwc0,Am I crazy with this long-term portfolio?,ne7hsfc,"Some random thoughts:

You have no exposure to emerging markets where most of the world's population lives.

You appear to be 100% invested in stocks. No other asset classes. No cash(?).

You own very few big companies from outside the US. No ASML, TSMC, BYD or Samsung for instance, even though you are heavily betting on tech. You don't even own any big US companies unless they happen to be listed on the NASDAQ. So no Visa, JPMorgan, WalMart or Oracle.

Why has big tech outperfomed for so long? Why have small caps underperformed for so long? You are expecting the former to continue but the latter to change. Why? What are the factors you had in mind when you made that decision? I'm not saying you're wrong. I just find it notable because you said this was your long term allocation.

If you want to be more diversified (at least in terms of stocks) you could take a look at the SPDR MSCI All Country World Investable Market UCITS ETF (Acc) ETF: IE00B3YLTY66

Personally, I'm a bit sceptical about small caps, so I own the ""regular"" ACWI that doesn't include small caps. SPDR MSCI All Country World UCITS ETF (Acc): IE00B44Z5B48

I'm very undecided what to do right now. The world seems to be changing rapidly and I have no idea what the outcome will be. I'm instinctively holding more interest paying cash equivalents at the moment, but maybe this is exactly the wrong thing to do because governments around the globe are finding it impossible to rein in deficits.",1757873391.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nguwc0/am_i_crazy_with_this_longterm_portfolio/ne7hsfc/

Broad,Investing,1ndvtc2,How is this for a retirement plan?,ndmkbjt,"A few reasons to use a TIPS ladder to bridge the gap to SS. Keep in mind that you would want to do this inside a 401k/traditional IRA for tax purposes.

Sequence of returns risk refers to the danger of retiring right before a market downturn. If you have to sell off your investments to cover living expenses while the market is down, you lock in losses and may jeopardize the long-term health of your portfolio. A TIPS ladder provides a ""safe"" source of cash for the first few years of retirement, allowing your riskier assets (like stocks) to ride out a market downturn without being touched.

A CD ladder will achieve a similar effect. With the CD ladder, you're gaining a higher rate but are introducing inflation risk.

Broad,Investing,1ndmdgi,ACWI or VT does the exposure to small cap/emerging markets matter?,ndijcua,"> ACWI 

Probably the returns that large caps have given for the smaller number of large/mid caps (~1100 stocks), while it takes a lot for a small cap in VT (with almost 10000 stocks) to register its gains.  SPGM has outperformed VT as well in the past 10 years by almost 1%, with only a modest increase in ER, with less overall stocks (SPGM is a little more “concentrated” to the developed large caps while keeping some small cap in its 2300 stocks). 

Was looking at it last night and ACWI may track a little better which is good for trading.  I just think of it as movement in the “really small caps” won’t move much market cap-wise. Similarly I’ll go with iShares ITOT (the top 2200 US stocks) over VTI (the top 4500 or so).  That mass of “very small to micro caps” won’t do much either vs the paperwork it creates. 

> outperforms 

Short term think the US still has it in terms of tech stocks, but long term .. not so sure.  My 20-30+ year portfolio is in SPGM (MSCI’s global investable index) as at least global copycats steal US share of markets.

If I'm wrong and my riskier investments don't work out (I mostly don't do individual stocks but use some sector ETFs when I want to lean my portfolio based on where I believe things are going), the loss won't be detrimental to my retirement. 

And absolutely you could get lucky and it will put you ahead of where you otherwise would have been.

However, at least 95% of people who are purchasing individual stocks are doing it on some sort of idea that ""tech will outperform"" or ""Amazon is great"" or some very basic idea. They have the illusion that they aren't gambling, but really, they are. They are just trading risk for return in an inefficient way. 

It's why most investors lose.

I recently met with an old, close friend. We talked about investing. He mentioned that his stock picking portfolio had outperformed his index portfolio by a few percent. I was skeptical, so he allowed me to look at his portfolio. I put everything into my portfolio analysis Python script. While the positions he held could have beaten the market, when you accounted for time out of the market (waiting to swap positions), he actually underperformed. When you accounted for tax drag, he underperformed further. When you looked at the Sharpe ratio, he took on drastically more risk for more return on these positions. If he had held the S&P, he would have done better, and if he wanted to juice his returns, he could have just either increased his allocation.

Very few people have the discipline to actually invest. Most people (like my friend) are just gamblers in disguise.",1757380292.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nbs1ng/why_are_so_many_index_fund_investors_dogmatic_and/nd6qae0/

the first stock i bought was $500 of APPL at around $18/share before the iphone, before the ipod, right when they released the original imac. i kept adding to the position because it was always better than their competition. i sold after steve jobs died.

when the original ipod came out, every single expert and analyst on cnbc said apple was crazy, they're a computer company, they can't compete with the sony walkman. nobody is going to pay $500 for an mp3 player. but a friend had one and i held one in my hand for a few seconds and i knew it was a gamechanger. so i bought even more stock, and ignored all the experts.

did the same for netflix, when every analyst said they'll lose to blockbuster. more recently i bought NVDA and PLTR right after chat gpt came out.

even with the stocks that don't do well, the winners more than make up for it. i almost never add to losing positions, and just buy more of the best performing stocks as they keep going up in price, which i think is the opposite of what a lot of people do.",1757352194.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nbs1ng/why_are_so_many_index_fund_investors_dogmatic_and/nd48q3x/

Nobody likes to talk about their misses.  Its largely psychological.   cognitive dissonance, mental accounting,  and other factors build this into our psyche.    So when someone in some conversation somehow brings up a big stock score, I automatically assume in my head that there are probably unspoken losses that hamper the true gain one might have actually gotten.   Imo its largely a fair assumption especially if its someone who wants to talk about it (potential need for validation).  

I know 2 guys who retired earlier and did so because of in one case RSU's and in another just making good bets early on.  I only know it because they've known me a long time(since i was a kid) and I basically asked.   otherwise they would not be a parties talking about their big win(s).

Companies have assets they leverage to generate revenue, while cash is an opportunity to purchase assets which may or may not generate value, and cash’s purchasing power in and of itself diminishes over time with inflation. Therefore, I like keeping my money in the market.

If it were me, I’d lump sum most of it into something like VTWAX (I want international exposure) and forget about it. Then I’d keep some (10-25%) to the side to get the higher risk behavior out of my system, such as picking industries, companies, and timing the market. I find that fun and rewarding.

Look into other indexes to diversify like VXUS (global excluding US) VTI (total US index not just S&P500) or VT (combo of VTI and VXUS). 

You probably dont need to hold both VOO and VTI if you look the top holdings are mostly the same. Just as you dont need to hold VOO+VXUS AND VT. Thats just buying the same stuff in a different fund. 

If youre super nervous about volatility, or youre later in life, Take a little bit…5%, 10%, 20% and buy BND (bond index)

Your “diversified” passive portfolio should be a balance of US, global markets, and if you choose, bonds. There is no good reason to have bonds while youre in the “growth” phase with long time horizons just dont panic sell in down years and stay the course. It will be fine. But if it makes you more comfortable then thats the right thing for you to do just know youre leaving money on the table. 

If you dont have a rainy day fund already, then take 6 months of expenses from your 300k and park in cash in a high yield savings account before you chuck it all into VOO. Mortage, insurance, utilities, basic expenses. If you lose your job or need a new roof or have to suddenly buy a car or have a medical issue you use that money. Just remember that you have to pay taxes on interest accrued each year. 

If you dont have a Roth IRA and you are working then make sure youre setting $7000 aside every year for that. You can park 3-5 years of that Roths grow tax free and pay out tax free but you cant touch them until youre 59.5 without penalties (with some exceptions) 

Then take the rest, and if you dont want to lump sum it, figure out over what period of time you want it invested and DCA it in. 

I would suggest 80% VOO, 20% VXUS, and no bonds. If you want bonds maybe its 70VOO/20VXUS/10BND. And maybe buy 100 shares here or a hundred shares there of companies youre really interested in that you use a lot. Its a good way to keep you interested in the financial market generally. Familiarity breeds comfort. Buy a little bitcoin if youre interested in crypto or lockheed martin if youre into military tech or stryker if youre into medtech. Whatever. Love racecars? Honeywell owns garrett turbochargers.

Finally, those are just the vanguard indexes. There are others through Fidelity or Blackrock or whomever. You have to look at their expense ratios and their composition to figure out what the best pick is (like i said about SPY vs VOO) but theyre largely interchangeable. You can checkout r/bogleheads for more on passive index investing. GLHF! DCA is the way! Set it and forget it. (But dont forget it in your case unless you want to keep DCAing $300k a year lol…)",1757347800.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nbbeu6/should_i_put_in_300k_cash_now/nd3tjd6/

There is only as much money at the table as people put there.  Every winner has a corresponding loser/losers of the same amount.

Now let’s make it a Negative sum game because there’s a dealer rake, and you have to tip.  So now the average person at the table loses. It becomes very very difficult to win over long periods of time unless you are almost pro-level and playing against newbies. Your advantage has to be enormous to overcome the losses due to subtractions by the “house.”

Now let’s imagine you have the stock market - money is added to the market in the form of returned profits via dividends and stock repurchases. So it is a Positive sum game. However, transaction costs (invisible) due to market makers and bid/ask spreads eat away at returns. In addition to this, whatever overhead a fund has will be subtracted from returns as well.  

If you have a fund subtracting 1-2% to pay managers and research, this helps very little because EVERYONE else in the active management business does the same. This space is heavily populated with skilled individuals (far more informed and better skilled than the ones posting on SeekingAlpha).  

This becomes similar to the Negative sum game of poker - except that earnings still produce buybacks and dividends which add to the “pot.”  So it’s still positive sum, but not as much as it SHOULD be if you just bought every single stock….

Here's a simple, straightforward example: if you do the typical 80/20 or 90/10 or whatever, **you will automatically lose to the index funds too**. Why? Because in the long run 100% equities beats having any amount of bonds at all!

But you're supposed to have some amount of bonds, to reduce your risk, right?

The traditional hedge funds are _hedging_, it's right there in the name. They have some maximum drawdown that they accept and they hedge against it by buying puts or whatever. That _necessarily_ alters their risk/return profile. (Of course, a lot of the old hedge funds were complete ripoffs with that 2-and-20 shit, but that's a different story from modern day ETFs with low expense ratios!)

Conversely, you can beat the market very easily! Use a little bit of leverage and some margin - boom, instant alpha. Of course, if the market dips far enough, you blow up your entire account that way. Oops.

The past 10 years I did a hybrid of: pick stocks and buy broad market ETFs, roughly 50/50 over that time period. Started out mostly picking stocks. Then kept shifting more and more into ETFs. Today I am holding 75% ETFs, 25% stocks while investing only in ETFs. 
I was mostly buying super depressed oversold blue chips that then typically outperformed the market (like IBM) within a few months, then sold. And I bought tech: Bought Google Amazon Tesla and Nvidia early, also made some good money with Xpeng, Xiaomi, buying them very early and selling at 5x.
I sold off and rebalanced a lot of these stocks and put that money into ETFs then. I got really lucky. My history of picking stocks and selling within 6-24 months is very profitable. Never with large sums though. Overall I came out ahead about 150k through the single stock picks over this roughly 10 year period. Now that I locked in most of it in ETFs, I kind of ""cheated the system"" and have a small head start.

The way to do it is rather straightforward.  Take highly concentrated positions in your best ideas.  Best ideas are not easy to find (obviously). But if you have a few and buy well you can absolutely out perform the market.  

As Buffett says, there’s no point in investing broadly in your top 20 best ideas. Concentrate on your top 1 and 2.

Also risk is not volatility.  Risk is knowledge and understanding. Many amateurs get this wrong.  If you know exactly what you are investing in — and do the work — you can use volatility to your advantage. Buy well.  Be happy when good stocks fall, not sad. 

The fact is most people who invest in individual stocks do not take time (or have the skill) to analyze companies. Who reads a balance sheet?  Very smart people roll the dice on stocks and really don’t know what they own.  That can often work out — you would not likely lose money investing in stocks like Microsoft, for example. They have high gross margins, and are riding a wave in many businesses. 

Many investors don’t even try to analyze companies.  If you have the skill and time, finding small innovative companies or deep value opportunities is very possible.  

So you might think: if it happens then why don’t know you hear more about it?  That’s a good question. I personally think the best investors (often) don’t want to manage other people’s money. They don’t need the hassle. Independence is their goal, not office work.  One example, famed investor Peter Lynch who ran Fidelity’s Magellan Fund and delivered high 20% annualized returns quit and retired in his late 40s.  It’s a lot stress investing for other people.

Oh, and I publish on SeekingAlpha.

In fact, most investments into private businesses outsize returns of the S&P, given that their financials are proven and financing mix is stable. 
Your ownership of a Chick-Fil-A will beat the market over and over again. 

What people often misunderstand is that any portfolio constructed of publicly traded companies with the same level of liquidity will not beat the S&P in terms of risk-efficiency. 
Active management of portfolios also rarely beat the S&P with consistently because of tax implications, bad judgement calls and under/over estimation of risk/return profile. 

You also need to look at time horizon. What frame of time are we capturing to compare the two to determine which performed better? 

I’ve had a client with a portfolio that consisted entirely of cash and Tesla stock. In 2015-2018, his portfolio was not efficient in producing returns. By 2023, we could look backward at his time invested and his portfolio ran circles around the market. 
If you simply count the number of years of beat vs not-beat, you’ll see the S&P almost unmatched. That said, this does not make it the only strategy for building net worth.

Generally you should pump tax advantaged retirement accounts before brokerage accounts (where you need to worry about capital gains). So hopefully the 3M is a mix of maxed retirement accounts for your age and then a brokerage acct for the rest.

Some generic advice, keep your diversified ETF/index funds indefinitely (you want to avoid paying that 15/20% LTCG rate as much as you can). Don't rotate those out to another investment. As you work through your career and start to approach retirement, you can switch from buying ETFs to buying bonds/fixed income. That's how you end up at a more optimal balance.

the greater total gain is to invest in equities.  Even fater x years you sell and pay your taxes, you'll be ahead of a pure income/dividend play (which is post tax since now you'd be paying tax every year).

Not trying to be rude...

This is a pure psychology issue in my opinion.  Just because you see a huge chunk of money being paid out, youd on't like it.  But, if you ""earned less"" and paid every year, you'd be happier.  I've seen it and talked to SO MANY people all the time.

Yes, if you want, realize some gains every year or few years.  Sell some positions and just buy them back.

Yes, when you retire, don't sell everythgin in one huge swoosh.  spread the pain out and make sure you stay within the 15% ltcg bracket.  (I assume we are talking about usa taxation)

even if you used a pre-tax account.. I tell my friends.. remember, a third or so of that isn't your money, when looking at the balance.  You still have to pay the deferred tax on it.

Yes, you don't have to rotate into income.  the 4% rule isn't based on income, although it based on a 8% or so historical average return of equities and bonds.

I would say that how you finance your retirement, and not just how you grow your wealth, is just as important.  If you are doing the Vanguard ""voo and chill,"" then I'd say it up to you to figure out how much effort you will put into financing your retirement.  if you knowledge and experience is nothing more than buying an etf based on Vanguard's recommendation, you will have a steep learning curve for any other strategies.

But they do reduce their stock value appreciation through paying dividends (2.55% for VYM.) That does help in the first year of ownership for sure, that I am considering. IE I am ready to retire, and have a large gain in BRK that is going to be a big tax event. The nice thing if I take that tax event this year, I can expect to get 2.55% of income next year from VYM that will be in qualified dividends. If instead I go full into VOO now, and pull out that same 2.55% next year, it will have the taxes for any gains from today until that period next year as income taxed gains.
Similar will be happening if I decided to move from VYM to a different fund before a year, I will be getting more 2.55% more of the growth in income taxes instead of dividend.
This is only advantaged in that I am 55, looking to retire at 56. i can put my IRA into a annuity and get $60k of lifetime income, and this %2.55 can give me $15k a year. which seams like a near perfect amount for retirement. the IRA will be all capital gains.

1. Most of my cash went into growth etfs in the begninning but I didn't choose VOO/VT. I didn't know about them until 2020, so I missed quite a few years of growth. I've since been moving into VOO and VT. 

2. A few dozen speculative stocks and crypto did very well for me. offset some of the gains with tax loss harvesting and sold the losers. Tax loss harvesting is still ongoing, but consolidating every year, and should be wrapped up by 2028 or 2029 tax year. 

Only loser I regret selling early is GE as that has done amazing the last few years. 

3. As my portfolio value grew to mid to high 6 figures, I transitioned to investing into fixed income and dividend stocks. This transition is still ongoing but given my age, most is still going into VOO/VT.

Broad,Investing,1n88rmq,Is it even worth it to invest in dividend ETFs when you don’t have a large amount of capital?,nck8hp2,"People will get on here and give you opinions OP.  Dividends are irrelevant, and total return is all that matters.  It’s all just smoked filled coffee house crap.  Yes you typically do need a large amount of capital to get a significant dividend income.  Personally I like to take a hybrid approach.  Dividends give me the peace of mind of having a regular income besides my job.  I turned 50 this year, so I am on the back nine and closer to a retirement date.  Can start to see it creeping up in the rear view mirror.  30 years ago I would have said yes you should be all in on growth.  Get that nest egg to as large as possible.  So when the time comes you can convert it to income.  I still believe this is the way today.  My dividend income surpasses my W2 income.  At 50 this is a very big comfort to me.  Ageism, and health play a large part in your decision making.  More than people realize.  It’s very easy to have lots of confidence when you’re younger because you have a longer runway to absorb mistakes.  When you have less than 10 years like myself you start to look at things from a security perspective in addition to returns.  For instance I paid off my mortgage last year.  This really helped to lower my living expenses, and solidify my feeling of security for the next 20-30 years.  I have CLL or Chronic Lymphocyctic Leukemia.  Was diagnosed in 2011, and have been on Calquence since 2018.  That said at 50 I am healthier than I was at 40.  The dividends I receive come from my brokerage account so it’s actually spendable cash after taxes.  With the health problems I wanted to have a reliable income source outside of social security, and 401k.  Also wanted the ability to retire early if I choose.  So now I have some freedom, and to me that‘s what dividends are all about.  Freedom.  The ability to do what I want.  I plan to work another 9 years at which time I will hit 59.5, and be eligible to withdraw from my 401k/IRAs.  Because of the CLL I plan to draw SS at 62.  Will most likely get a reduced amount if the govt doesn’t do something.  So invest for growth and dividends both.  Currently with all the funds I have 2/3rds is invested in an income portfolio.  There is a mix of BDCs, CLOs, REITs, Covered Call ETFs, Preferreds, Energy, Credit, and some commodities/digitals (gold/crypto).  Personally I don’t own any Roundhill or Yieldmax.  They are poison for durable income in my opinion.  The other 1/3rd is invested in growth mostly focused around the AI trade.  I have worked in IT for the last 30 years as a voip engineer.  So I see first hand the impact AI has on the world.  My belief is it’s not going away, and despite high current valuations I still think it’s going to offer pretty phenomenal returns in the long term.  As I get closer to 59.5 I will start converting 23% of the final 33% to income.  Overall I plan to leave 10% of my portfolio in high growth to give it a chance to continue to grow.  If it does well I will trim the position to be 10% overall, and have some extra money to take a vacation or something.  So dividends are irrelevant is a generic narrow minded mindset.  I would say they are irrelevant to who?  Because I know I enjoy having the income stream and the freedom that comes with it.  We don’t operate in a vacuum, and there is real risks to go all one direction or the other.  Just VOO and chill, and you run the risk of sequence of returns just prior to, at the beginning, or shortly after starting retirement.  This could leave you without enough capital to live on.  Dividends can be cut or eliminated.  So if you were all in on that strategy you could have the rug pulled out from under you at a critical time.  Diversity is your friend, and finding a strategy that works for you is the real answer here.  My suggestion would be to try before you buy.  Just like anything test drive it.  You know buy some growth, and buy some income.  See how it does for a year.  If you like the results buy some more, and if not reevaluate.  Just don’t buy in lock, stock, and barrel to anything without seeing if it fits you.  It’s not one size fits all.

EDIT: Sorry it’s long winded.  The other best advice I can give is don’t buy into the lifestyle social media crap.  We have a significant nest egg because I have always lived well below my means.  Even though I could literally walk into a Bentley dealership, and buy two or three of them I still drive a 2007 Toyota Avalon.  It’s a nice car with a faded paint job that I can afford to drive, and afford to have repaired when it breaks down.  We live in a nice, but modest house that meets our wants and our needs.   By living that lifestyle I was able to go buy a retirement home for my wife and I and pay cash.  We are remodeling the house to suit our needs, and wants.  I am doing all the work myself though.  Too many people put effort and tons of money into trying to look like they have money.  Buy assets not liabilities, and collect interest don’t pay it.

SCHD & VYM annualized 10 year return has been 9.3% while SPY was 13.5% and QQQ was 14.2%.  Over a five year span SCHD and VYM look relatively better (13% return, vs 13.8% for QQQ).   On the other hand, Nasdaq (pre-QQQ) was so brutally ravaged in 2000 that it took until 2018 to get your real dollars back (2015 or 2016 in nominal dollars).   If you had retired on QQQ in 2000, you'd likely be dead before breaking even, slowly cashing out your retirement at a loss.

>  forced annual taxation on money you don't need and will just reinvest anyways.

Zero tax for married couple making less than $94,000, then 15% up to $583,000.  This might be a tolerable hit.   Imagine moving $2M of non-401K money into dividend stocks at the age of 62, for an annual income of $80K, plus an expected appreciation/income growth of 5%.   Your Social Security would push *some* of this into  the modest 15% bracket.  However, if you had a growth fund instead, then cashing out would be subject to comparable cap gains tax.   Dividends are likelier than stock values to hold steady in a downturn, so you're less likely to have to dig into depreciated capital.

>  To be clear that is not allowed in the US but I would love a VOO/VTI l

Sounds like you might want some BRK-B.   Not quite the same thing (active diversified fund, stocks and private holdings and cash reserves) but has had exceptional returns and never  paid a dividend.

>  However to intentionally pick stocks/MF/ETFS based on the size of the dividend is dubious. The increase in tax drag makes it even more so.

Most value funds seem to have paid returns the same 5 and 10 year returns as SCHD and VYM (while paying about 2% dividend).  So dividend funds are essentially value funds, so by your argument, if you don't want the income, SCHD and VTV are interchangeable, minus *slightly* smaller tax hit for VTV (2% dividend, not 3.9%).

When they deliver 7% *real* growth, pay something like  3% in dividends, which is taxed at 15%, then the total tax hit on returns is 1/10 of the 7% real return, or 0.7%.  That might be an acceptable factor for somebody who believes that growth stocks (eg, QQQ) can suffer punishing two-decade crashes like in 2000.",1757012148.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n88rmq/is_it_even_worth_it_to_invest_in_dividend_etfs/ncf8qwc/

**It is just all around worse.  If someone can't handle the volatility of 100% VTI then 85/15 is better than SCHD in every possible metric.**  IF they want even LESS risk (and accepting less return) then every combination of VTI and IEF has better risk adjusted return than SCHD.

Broad,Investing,1n88rmq,Is it even worth it to invest in dividend ETFs when you don’t have a large amount of capital?,ncdr5fq,"You're still missing the point.

If you're talking risk-adjusted returns, then you're leaving risk out of the conversation.  Importantly, risk-adjusted returns are a worthless metric to someone whose capital could be essentially wiped out in a downturn.  This likely describes the OP.  All else being equal, ETFs bring risk down via diversification (even if it's not whole-market exposure) while dividend-issuing companies tend to be more mature and less volatile.  Remember, too, that all risk is *relative* and the PotUSA is currently trying to tank the value of the dollar and destroy its role as a global reserve currency.  So appealing to historical safe-haven arguments would be potentially harmful without significant added context.

Moreover, for newer or lower-income investors, the tax efficiency question is far simpler than people make it out to be.  Most people like OP are likely to hang on to their positions long enough that their dividend income would qualify for 15% or maybe even 0% tax.  So it's just a matter of sticking to US tickers, or qualified foreign issuers if they really want geographic diversification.

Then, you have the choice of account in which to place the investment.  An IRA enables the investor to manage their tax burden by managing their drawdown (a function of desired lifestyle and other income during retirement).  A Roth IRA enables them to pretty much negate the tax burden entirely.  Lower-income investors are unlikely to be coming to this forum having topped up either account, so advice should include the use of these accounts.",1756996954.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n88rmq/is_it_even_worth_it_to_invest_in_dividend_etfs/ncdr5fq/

Yes, the amount they pay out will decline in an economic downturn, but the whole idea is that you don't sell any of the 30,000 shares of SCHD or whatever, and when the market comes back you're good as new. Once you'd sold off extra shares of SPY in a down market to fund living expenses, those extra shares that were liquidated are now gone from your portfolio. It's possible to keep at a hard 3% regardless of what happened to your portfolio's overall value, but that runs the risk of having some extremely lean periods when the market is down.

I'm also curious as to what the actual average dividend yield was for SCHD over the time span in the chart. It's compared to an easy to calculate 3% withdraw from SPY, but would that 3% have resulted in more or less income than what SCHD would have been paying out over the same time frame?",1756427956.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n2qi1c/dividends_provide_only_behavioral_benefits/nb8erwf/

Selling reduces your ownership stake in the company, and you receive the current market price for your shares.

You can only sell the shares you have. Dividends can be perpetual. You’re only looking at the short-term impact of dividend payments.

The bottom line is that dividend investing isn’t for everyone. Many would find even a minority holding of equities too risky in retirement. Many more than that won’t ever accrue enough capital to fund their lifestyle indefinitely and are forced to gradually liquidate assets by the time they stop working. Another large subset of investors also subscribe to the “die with zero” philosophy where the goal is to spend down as much as possible before death; any capital left over after they die is effectively wasted, this is really common in the FIRE crowd. Pretty much no one should be holding a significant amount of high dividend bearing assets during their accumulation phase.

It's the personal part of personal finance; not everything is for everyone.",1756494289.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n2qi1c/dividends_provide_only_behavioral_benefits/nbd7qka/

Broad,Investing,1n2qi1c,Dividends Provide Only Behavioral Benefits,nbd7tq6,"I’m not arguing the arithmetic with you. Your arithmetic is spot on. Im not arguing against non-dividend paying companies either. Each type of investment has its place. I’m saying that selling a stock at a disadvantageous price is never a good investment decision, and that dividends are a more sustainable source of liquidity. Share count matters not because of the influence you have as an owner, but because share count x price = value of equity. 

If you’re reducing (selling) shares in a down market, the amount of money you’ll make when the market recovers is less than it would be if you held on those shares.

When I receive dividends, I get a return of value and get to retain the shares. I can reinvest those dividends, pay bills, debt, etc. When the market recovers I get to realize the benefit from all the shares I held. Not a smaller portion of them. 

High growth, non dividend paying stocks can be great if you can stomach the volatility. But selling shares, at a discount, in need of liquidity, is an inferior way of getting cash.

Again, you want to take advantage of the market, not be at its whims.

No and I can prove it with math!

So in my above example you agree 1 and 2 are more or less equivalent but then you are saying this does not work in a down market ? The math is still the same . If I change the company only to be worth 50 million after a crash the math is still the same except now the dividend is 2% for 10k or I could sell 2% with out a dividend

So lets say the company crashes and is only worth 50 million its a bad 50% crash but I still need to make 10k to live or whatever I own 1% of the now 50 million company

1. I still pays a 1 million dividend same as above , but now that 1 million dividend is 2% , So now I own 1% of a 49 million dollar company , leaving me with 490k equity value and 10k cash
2. I still need 10k so now I have to sell 2% instead , so that leaves me with .98% ownership of a 50 million company . leaving me with 490k equity value and 10k cash

The math is the same. I somehow won't ""miss out"" on returns with #2 if the companies total returns going forward are the same. You could also argue if you do not re-invest dividends you will miss out on the same future returns, its the same. Why because in both cases I have 490k invested into both companies , if going forward they start to recover and both have total returns of 10% over the next few years, in both cases my 490K grows at the same rate

So lets move to year 2, both companies return 20% in a recovery and this is where the dividend crowd always makes a mistake as they assign a different total return to both companies and yes if one company has a higher total return well it will return more what is not an earth shattering conclusion . So after my down year both have the same total return next year of 20%

1. Still pays a 1 million dividend  so it appreciates 20% then pays a 1 million dividend (49M \* 1.20)=58.8M but it pays a 1 million dividend ending with a value of 57.8M . Technically its dividend yield would be 1.7% and it would have appreciated from 49m to 57.8 or 18.3% but also paid a 1.7% dividend to give you a total return of 20%

Ok your ending balance is still 10k (your 1%  \* 1 million dividend) cash and 1% of 57.8 M or 578k

2. The company returns 20% same as above . I still sell my 10k amount . S0 (50M\* 1.2)=60 million

So my stake is .98% of 60M or 588k before I sell , just like your dividend I need to sell 1.7% of my shares to get  my 10k cash

So after selling 1.7% of my shares I am left with a .96333% ownership in a 60 million company or......578k and 10k cash!

I did not lose out on any future returns by selling any more then I would lose out on future returns by not reinvesting my dividends! The math proves it.",1756499357.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n2qi1c/dividends_provide_only_behavioral_benefits/nbdoez9/

Yes, the market averages 8–12% over the long term, but averages are misleading. There are long stretches (even a decade+) where returns were flat or negative. If you're borrowing at 6%, you need a plan for what happens when the market underperforms — not just ""I'll sit it out"", but ""here's the alternative place I'll move that capital that can reliably beat 6%."" If you don’t have that plan, the leverage can backfire quickly.

There *are* solutions (asset rotation, alternative income strategies, hedging, etc.), but they require study and preparation before you start. Otherwise you're taking a very concentrated bet that the next 5 years will look like the long-term average.

So: the strategy isn't crazy in theory — it's just a high-risk, high-maintenance play.

long-term, yes. but that can be very very long-term of several decades. 8-10% returns are not guaranteed, and can be much lower than average in some periods

9% average returns can mean 14%/year for one decade, and 4%/year returns for the next decade. across that 20-year period, it would average out to 9%/year.

Broad,Investing,1n1nzo2,Audit my stock picks (advice needed),nazyl6y,"Most people would describe a medium risk portfolio as something like 60% stocks, 30% bonds, and 10% cash/T-bills. IMO high risk tolerance calls for something like 75-85% $VOO and/or other broad market index fund, 15-25% individual stocks. High risk isn't necessarily bad if your young and can stomach large potential losses. It's how I'd describe my personal portfolio. I'd describe your current portfolio as very high risk.   
  
Personally, I'd diversify out of MSTR if you not into very high risk. MSTR is basically a leveraged crypto play which is extremely high risk. Their market cap is something like $30B higher than their BTC holdings. It's growth mechanism is entirely reliant on its ability to constantly raise more and more funds by issuing convertible bonds to purchase BTC. Current valuation is reliant on that process continuing.

I won't get into all the math, watch the vid I linked if you want details, but basically they use what MSTR calls ""intelligent leverage"".

They issue bonds which can be converted into shares to raise capital, then they use that capital to buy BTC. The way the math works out, their holdings of BTC increases at a faster rate than the dilution of their own shares. So over time each share becomes worth more and more BTC. So by buying and holding MSTR you will eventually own a greater quantity of BTC than you would have if you bought it directly. So the earlier you bought in the better you are doing right now.

The catch is it relies on constantly raising capital via these convertible bonds. If they aren't able to get people to buy their bonds then all the people who bought shares recently at a premium relative to MSTR's BTC holdings get fucked.",1756327442.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n1nzo2/audit_my_stock_picks_advice_needed/nb0k59j/

The one piece of advice I'd offer is to be careful with the concentration of individual stocks. Given that retirement is only 10-12 years away, your portfolio's risk level is something to watch closely. While individual stocks can provide great gains, they can also introduce volatility that can be tough to stomach when you're closer to needing the income. What works for a 25-year-old with a 40-year time horizon is very different from what's appropriate for someone looking to retire in a decade.

Then figure out what your total annual spend is and keep half that (6months worth) in the HYSA as an emergency fund.

After that it's time to assess your investment psychology before deciding what to do with the rest. You need to have a plan that will be able to weather market downturns, the secret to compounding returns is time. The S&P500 dropped almost 20% in less than 2 months this year (between 2/19 and 4/8) and has since more than recovered. The people that held have done well, the people that sold at the bottom lost significantly. If you bought $400k of VOO on 2/19 and panic sold on 4/8, you would have lost $80k.

Second, I'd consider how much you really need in the next few years. Money you won't need within 5ish years should be invested in the market to earn the largest return. Contribute that to your 401k (or Roth 401k, Roth IRA, Trad IRA) depending on your tax situation. With 100k total income filing jointly, you probably will want post-tax contributions unless you plan to retire early quite frugally.

there was so much fear being spread on reddit lol this time is different, will take 20 years to recover, we could never recover, we're going to zero.  it was bad.  people were making videos that they lost their entire 401k (I don't know how that's even possible).  I don't see any videos about 401k's being at ATHs as of today.

what you need to do is figure out why you didn't buy because a dip, a correction, a crash, will all happen in the future.  just be patient.  great thing about the market is opportunities always present themselves.  always.  

just because the market has recovered doesn't mean it's 100% you should have bought.  warren buffet said it best:

you want to buy into a company that you will grow with over the next 20 years.  if you buy them today and tomorrow, they are 30% less, you should be happy.  you get them at a great price.  why do you want them to go up in value?

Google AI Overview: (does Tesla display many of these qualities?) too volatile too

“A blue chip stock is the share of a large, financially sound, and well-established company with a national reputation for quality, reliability, and consistent profitability, often referred to as an industry leader. These companies typically have large market capitalizations, strong brand recognition, and a history of stable growth and dependable dividend payments, making them a popular choice for long-term investors seeking stability and lower risk. 
Key Characteristics
Financial Stability: Blue chip companies are financially strong and healthy, often with billions in market capitalization. 
Established Reputation: They possess a long history of consistent performance, reliable earnings, and are well-respected leaders in their sectors. 
Market Dominance: Blue chip stocks often represent companies that are at or near the top of their industry, featuring in major stock indexes like the S&P 500. 
Stable Dividends: Many blue chip companies regularly pay dividends to their shareholders, often increasing them over time. 
Lower Volatility: These stocks are generally less volatile and more resilient than smaller stocks, making them a lower-risk option. “",1755848001.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mtb2nq/my_4_year_tesla_investing_journey_to_0_return/na1b3y5/

The formula is x * (1+y)^n, where x = amount invested, y = rate of return, and n = number of investment periods (e.g. years)

In our scenario, rate of return is positive because we already assumed that the something goes up over time (because a century of history says that on average the stock market goes up over time)

Therefore, for a non-negative x (duh), increasing n leads to a higher return

This isn't a mathematical proof because it's braindead maths. It's too basic to need a formal proof. Like 1+1=2 isn't a mathematical proof

Now, obviously there's volatility. Our example simply said *on average over time*. y can fluctuate from year to year - which is why you DCA to smooth it out if you're worried about volatility.

If I were to sell, that 50% is profit, taxable at 30%. So I really only have 35% profit margin if I sell. Is it worth that 35% growth to sell? That's still pretty good growth, and in a company with a structure that will weather most problems, long-term.  
  
So I say ask yourself these questions:  
1) Do you want the cash, or just some kind of safety?  
2) How close are you to retiring and/or wanting these funds?  
3) What promises more grown than what you've already seen?  
4) where would you put this newly-taxed income if you were to reinvest?  
  
My advice: Sell a bit. It's a solid stock and will earn you a lot more, ESPECIALLY with how much you have. Sell a bit, and diversify that. Keep investing, but don't invest any more into AMZN. Leave it to cook until you want to sell it off for income. Maybe 20k-50k tops from that 200k, and use that as your stake for whatever other investments you want.",1755186936.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mpdyuh/what_to_do_with_200k_in_amzn/n8o6fxb/

TDF are designed to underperform. Its goal is to make sure you have a safe nest egg to retire with. As you age and approach retirement age it sells stock and buys bonds.

So assuming you’re 40, your 2050 fund should be 40% bonds and 60% stocks.

We are close to an all time high. The tax bill passed, which is the primary recent impetus. Average rate of return, is not actual rate of return. The sequence of returns matter. If you have a 40% loss during retirement, you may not live long enough to break even, much less beat inflation. Diversification is crucial. 

Let’s say you retired in 2000. You are 100% equities. You take a 40% hit. You are not ahead till 2008. Then you get another 40% hit. 

You may not be ahead for the rest of your life. Another thing to think about is how averaging negative years, minimizes the actual impact and misleads. Let’s say you take a 40% hit. You have to make a gain over 60%, to get back to where you left off, and that does not take into account inflation.

If you factor in inflation, Spy was essentially flat or negative, from 1966 to 1982, so while it may not collapse, being diversified beyond the stock market is worthwhile. There have been a number of corrections and bear markets that caused problems. Two roughly -40% ones under Bush 2 alone.

Spy corrections

* The Great Depression (1929-1932): -86% over 34 months, taking approximately 25 years to recover.
* 1937-1938 Fed raises rates, market down 58%
* Global Financial Crisis (2007-2009): -57% from its peak in October 2007 to its low in March 2009. 
* Dot-Com Bust (2000-2013): -49% as the technology bubble burst. It took over seven years to recover. 
* Nixon Shock/OPEC Oil Embargo (1973-1980): -48% drop occurred during this period.
* Black Monday (October 19, 1987): The S&P 500 experienced its largest single-day percentage loss, falling -20.47% in one day.",1755045304.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mogelu/what_does_everyone_think_of_the_market_these_days/n8dxntd/

I think the best thing we can do in that regard is to try and show them that investing can be very interesting and rewarding.

You could set up a custodial account, invest into a couple index funds and tell them not to mess with it after they're 18. But then they're not really learning anything.

Can investing be fun for kids? I'd like to think so, but I know it's much easier said than done. 

My grandfather tried to teach me as a teenager; he put a small amount of money into a couple Vanguard mutual funds and tried to explain how a brokerage works and the basics of investing. I had zero interest at the time, and it wasn't something instilled in me by my parents. It wasn't until I was a few years into my career that I started to understand the value of long term investing.

So my current plan, as they get older, is to explain why it's important to me and why it's potentially life changing. To discuss different investment strategies and try to identify what strategies align with their personalities. To share books that I've read and hard lessons I've learned.

If this sparks an interest, I'd like to set up a custodial account. The majority (probably around 90-95%) would be allocated to something like an S&P100 index fund. But the remaining 5-10% would be for them to actively manage with whatever strategy catches their interest. They will make mistakes; they might even lose the majority of that 5-10%. But there will be tangible rewards and consequences to their choices, without train wrecking the whole account.

As they transition into adulthood, and refine their knowledge and techniques, the money in the index fund could then be reallocated into what they see fit.

Still a work in progress, but that's the best I've been able to come up with so far.",1755019141.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mo89lf/safegrowth_ideas_for_kids_account/n8bk8bl/

If you hold all small-cap value, you are taking way more risk than holding a broad index. Someone here mentioned that SCV beats the index on a risk-adjusted basis which is wrong. If it were the case, why would you buy an index then? Go all in on SCV because it's a free lunch, right? No, because the standard Sharpe ratio measurement for factor portfolios doesn't measure all of the risk that your portfolio has. Sharpe ratio is calculated based on volatility, which is only 1 dimension of risk according to the Fama-French model. Your portfolio's exposure to smaller companies is another independent dimension of risk, your portfolio's exposure to value companies is also another independent risk. In other words, risk is multi-dimensional. You cannot just focus on volatility/Sharpe-ratio.

SCV is *not* a free lunch, you are taking more risk and expecting higher returns, which is consistent with the efficient market hypothesis.

SCV might drop really hard during some of the worst possible drawdowns (look at the 2008 crash or the COVID crash). While you are getting higher returns per unit of volatility, the extreme drawdowns can be very devastating. That's why some people shy away from it. 

>Why is the S&P 500 still considered a good general investment for most people 5+ years before retirement when if you did 50/50 VIOV/VOO from early on, you'd probably perform way better just because you're buying out of favor companies? I just don't see the S&P 500 providing better returns going forward than the broader market.

Your concerns are not unfounded. Academically speaking, S&P 500 doesn't have a premium, it is being promoted because most people are looking at recent returns (recency bias). Right now, it's very top-heavy, the top 4 companies represent 25% of the index. Out of 500 companies, the top 10 were mostly responsible for the recent growth. 

People are falling for the AI hype just like they did for the internet in 2000s. If you had 100% VOO in 2000, you were going to experience a brutal crash that recovered only 7 years later, and you would have had a 0 % something CAGR in that period, too. With VTI, you would have had a small but positive CAGR. A properly diversified portfolio shouldn't be betting on large-caps only.   
  
A lot of ""100% VOO"" people assume that 10% CAGRs are just given, but with current valuations, it is foolish to assume you are going to get the same CAGR for the next 10-15 years. Vanguard was recently suggesting moving the allocation to 60% bonds/ 40% stocks (equally split between US and international) because they are also predicting that the future returns for the US market are going to be way lower than the bond returns. 

VTI/AVUS/DFAC have higher expected returns based on the factor models because they have mid-caps and small-caps.",1755019900.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mo76y4/if_growth_doesnt_provide_a_compensated_risk/n8bmsxj/

Value doesn't have better *risk adjusted* returns though. You only get better risk adjusted returns from diversification.

Suddenly the Internet became available - which not just allowed people other ways to buy stocks and ETFs but it also allowed them to do research and learn about funds and the underlying metrics that cause stock prices to rise and fall - And of course the biggest was the rise of ETF with everyone and her brother DCA and into voo/spy etc - every Friday nationwide there are millions of people who do zero research and zero buttons to push they just automatically buy $100-300(or a lot more) in sp500 ETFs which are heavily weighted towards the top companies.

But book value or ttm earnings is not a complete picture of a company's cashflows. It's just one year's worth. If all companies had identical growth rates, low P/E would be equivalent to a high discount rate and return, but they don't.  

It turned out historically that people were putting too low a P/E on declining companies and too high on growing companies. That led to a value premium. If, hypothetically, the premium reversed, growing companies would still have a higher P/E than declining ones, but the divide would be smaller than it should be.",1755052098.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mo76y4/if_growth_doesnt_provide_a_compensated_risk/n8eg6q7/
Broad,Investing,1mo76y4,"If growth doesn't provide a compensated risk premium, why don't we hold all value?",n8b26g1,">I realized that what matters is that the value premium isn't negative. Even if somehow the value premium managed to disappear and is actually zero, that just means that we'd have the returns of the overall market, I gather.

That would be great, but we don't have any such guarantee. Sometimes value stocks are just losers. We've been seeing growth just trounce for fifteen years and it's possible that will continue, with a value portfolio severely underperforming the average. After all, you have no guarantee of getting the average returns of the stock market unless you _hold_ the average.

>Was sharing discussion with someone here about intellect versus temperament. I don't know if you need to be smart to invest in a value tilted portfolio, but you certainly need temperament to see the underperformance as a discount. Even VIOV only traded sideways for like 7 years max. Investing consistently, you'd still come out ahead even within just that time period.

Nicely played response. 

I think the fama/french paper is way down the list. 

I think the mass dca into voo (which is heavily weighted towards top growth stocks is the second biggest factor possible. 

But I was mainly trying to say - the Internet changed EVERYTHING. - before 1992 companies were valued differently. Companies became great because they were able to be innovative and do things better than other companies. But the internet leveled that playing field - any average Joe logistics specialist /shipper / trucker / delivery guy - etc - they have all seen they productivity sky rocket over the past 25-30 years as everything is more productive since the invention of the world wide web 🌎 - but a lot of those companies that existed 25-30 years ago didn't see their profits sky rocket. They improved their margins but the ones who made the big bucks was the internet providers and picks and shovels that helped make the Internet's shift possible. (Microsoft apple Netflix Facebook/meta T-Mobile Amazon google and more recently Nvidia) and others but I hope you see the point I am trying to make - what I am saying is that the internet kick started growth and Moore's law (or war) is the only thing that can slow it down. Value investing was great in the 80's but I can't see how it ever comes back with the way people and hedge funds invest these days. 

People still read books of wisdom written decades ago by Benjamin Graham and Warren buffet and others. But everything changed!! and those rules don't really apply any more. 

I can't figure out how to put it in words. But if you like analogies - it's like if you read a book from 1970's about major league baseball and then try to apply it to today's baseball - it's not even the same game - with spin rates and analytics and rule changes to favor....XYZ. the same applies to the stock market - the game has changed.",1755070645.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mo76y4/if_growth_doesnt_provide_a_compensated_risk/n8fi8cl/

I just meant that the S&P 500 is generally recommended for everyone and their cousin and I don't think it's really the best advice to ignore the smaller, more valuable companies. I agree that the S&P 500 is probably safer and less volatile as a sole equity holding 6-7 years before retirement. 

Okay, a lot of good points here that you're making. I guess there is actually a very good argument to have an asset manager if you don't have a defined benefit pension. It's also frankly another good argument for annuities in some instances.

I don't know as much as you about IQ distribution, but I see what you're saying and I think we have to have enough self awareness to ultimately know ourselves. I've also heard stories about people cashing out their 401K's during market troughs and it breaks my heart. 

I guess it comes down to investing in what you understand. If you don't ""understand"" or have strong conviction about why you are buy small cap value, then yes, it will be much harder to stick with when seeing that tracking error as opposed to seeing the blessing of the discounts. Some people would do better with house flipping and/or rental income, or risk parity portfolios that are only 40-50% in equities if we can't understand that market downturns are a good thing.

You probably hit the nail on the head, it's the ""hold"" part of buy and hold that's tougher with SCV and equities in general. I guess it makes sense why the S&P 500 is the go to. Even Buffet says that investing is primarily behavioral. Personally, I'm 30% US SCV and 15% ex-US SCV...

You brought up one (well, a few) interesting points. Do you think IQ plays into blaming the wealthy for one's own situation?

Buffet wasn't the only one, but a few successful investors claim that temperament is more important than intellect. Even if someone has a lower IQ, can they still possess the temperament for sound investing strategies using funds?

I'm curious, what advice would you give to a late bloomer drawn to Ray Dalio's work, acknowledging that we all are genetically programmed for meaningful work and relationships, but just not seeing the lucrative possibility of pursuing joy for work? In other words, is it realistic to seek joy/fulfilment in our vocation or is it better to gravitate towards things we can excel at and try to be a little less attached to things like joy & fulfillment for that 40-60 hours/week?

Despite this I do understand how you feel, but at the same time I felt the same way exiting the housing market crash of 2008. I kept thinking, ""should I wait for a better time?"" and delayed an entire year when I would have had much better returns just starting as soon as possible, and prior to that I could have gone in at market lows but was afraid of how things were.

If it makes you feel better you can do smaller chunks monthly. There is very little chance for the stock market to spike up huge in a 1 year period so you can just do that if you feel better about it. In this way you can capture a small amount of downturn.",1754955145.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mnsm15/300k_cash_now_or_wait_till_weeks_over/n876cyj/

Broad,Investing,1mnsm15,300k cash now? Or wait till weeks over,n87llcz,"Best advice I ever received is to sink money in over time to average out the undulations when reinvesting cash or investing a lump sum. 
How much you sink into your portfolio per month is going to depend on your income and time horizon. Higher incomes can make up the losses, usually pushing it into the market sooner and over shorter periods. 

If you have a long time horizon (20 years+), you can put it all in at once knowing it will likely have gains that overwhelm short term pains. If it’s a shorter term, say , 5-7 years, you may try averaging it in over the year to flatten out the single-year risk of front loading the investment. 

As for the income being part of the equation, here’s how I look at it: 

If I have a lump sum of 5k, I’ll probably sink all of it in in one month. That’s because the amount is roughly our household average savings anyway.  
If it was 20k, I might try to average that in over the next 3 months. 
It’s not a perfectly linear relationship. Sometimes markets decouple from fundamentals, oversell and provide opportunities for you to put more in than you would have otherwise.

As long as you transfer shares rather than selling them, you won't be triggering a taxable event.  The taxable event will come if the shares are in your personal Vanguard acct and you decide to sell them.  If they've been held for over a year (likely in an inheritance) they will trigger long-term capital gain taxes which are taxed at a lower rate.  I do know that any partial shares will be sold during the transfer which may trigger a very minimal taxable event as partial shares cannot be transferred. 

The whole process was easy, at least with fidelity.  I opened my acct, went to 'transfer accts to fidelity,' added the brokerage name and acct. number and fidelity took care of the rest.  They just emailed me when it was complete.   Took less than a week. Super simple, I'm assuming Vanguard is similar.

BC the roth ira has already been taxed, I'd probably have the brokerage sell the shares from that account before transfering them and buy VTI or VOO or whatever you want once you've put the cash into your Vanguard acct.

Broad,Investing,1mmtgjb,What are your thoughts on VOO vs QQQ,n88dt2o,"1.  QQQ is more expensive.  Not super expensive, but more so than VOO or most other S&P500 funds.

2.  QQQ is less diverse.  It's US only stocks, and tech heavy.  This introduces more uncompensated risk.  Risk that can be mitigated by diversification is not compensated risk.

3.  As somebody mentioned, the idea of using that specific index as an investing strategy is stupid.  There is no reason to specifically invest in the top 100 companies traded on a specific exchange.

4.  QQQ is basically performance chasing.  Literally the only reason people talk about it is because it has done very well the past 10-15 years.  This is largely because it is tech heavy, and tech has done well that past 10-15 years.  People are essentially flocking to it as a sector-heavy fund.  Sector outperformance is very cyclical, and it is unlikely that tech will be the big winner the next decade, and the decade after that.  Tech is not a magic sector that just offers returns higher than the broad market.  Sectors do not offer a risk premium.

I say all this as somebody that owns like $30,000 of QQQM.  It bought it for dumb reasons, before I knew better.  It's in a taxable account, so I'll just let it ride instead of paying taxes on the gains.

VOO tracks the S&P 500, which is about 500 of the largest U.S. companies — mostly large-cap stocks. It’s very straightforward, big-name companies you’ve heard of, and it tends to be slightly less volatile.

VTI tracks the total U.S. stock market, which includes those same large companies plus mid-caps and small-caps. That gives you a bit more diversification and exposure to companies that aren’t in the S&P 500. Historically, performance between the two has been extremely close, with VTI sometimes pulling ahead slightly because of small-cap growth.

If you want pure exposure to the biggest companies, VOO is simple and effective. If you want maximum U.S. market diversification in a single fund, VTI is the way to go.

""Some overlap"" is putting it gently: VTI fully includes VOO, plus thousands of additional US companies (roughly VTI = VOO + VXF at market cap weights). Right now, the weight VOO would get inside VTI is over 80%, leaving less than 20% for VXF.

I'd go with VTI for the free diversification, as there's plenty of times where market favor is with the smaller companies (long term actually tends to favor small over large, VOO is fairly young and has only really existed during a large cap favor period).

However, with either one, I'd be sure to also include some international coverage (someone mentioned VT: think of that as basically, not exactly, VTI + international combined into one at market cap weights).",1754782164.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mm2x6w/if_you_had_an_extra_50_a_month_voo_or_vti/n7ut6fp/

Broad,Investing,1mm0rzo,"At 37, how “aggressive” can I be?",n7ux605,"37 is getting to where you “start your descent” (to use flying terminology) from cruising altitude.

The optimal risk/reward profile for someone with a typical amount saved is around 80-85% in equities (think S&P500) and the balance in a mix of bonds.

If you are way behind, you’ll need to be slightly more aggressive to avoid the risk of not having enough at retirement.

If you’re way ahead, you’ll can go higher in bonds to reduce the risk of lower returns from equities, but really just sticking to around 80-85% in equities is not far off.

You can think of allocation strategies like in American football.  If you are behind, you may need to play more aggressively.  If you’re behind in the first quarter by a little, it doesn’t change much.  If you’re behind in the 4th quarter, you will need to do some riskier plays to catch up.

On the contrary, if you are way ahead early in the game, you can’t just take a knee the whole game but you can play safely and still likely win.  You don’t want to do risky plays as winning by more points doesn’t change anything and riskier plays give your opponent a chance to come back.

Late in the 4th, if you’re up it may make sense to even intentionally lose on plays (ie take a knee or just run the ball) to reduce the risk of a turnover.

Those who say S&P500 all the way to retirement are going for as high a potential portfolio balance, even at the risk of not having enough at retirement.  If you don’t need much for retirement, it doesn’t matter.  If you aren’t ahead or behind, allocation matters for maxing your chance of having enough for retirement.",1754783657.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mm0rzo/at_37_how_aggressive_can_i_be/n7ux605/

The best time to invest in an ETF is yesterday. Second best time is today.

Trying to time when to jump into ETF's means you're really interested in playing the stock market, not interested in just idling cash in some location for a long period of time.

You can do both at the same time.

Start by setting up auto-investing into an ETF. Doing that with an IRA or 401k plan is a good idea, b/c then that thing can dca-n-chill over time.

Then create a personal brokerage account where you funnel a bit of cash for actively-managed stock trading.

That's what I do. I have a 401k from work that DCA-n-chills into an index ETF. But, I also funnel money into a personal brokerage that I can use to play with individual stock purchases. If I screw up on my stock purchases, I know my retirement is still safe, b/c I have a very heavy ""hands off"" approach to it.

Also make sure your 401k is invested into something thats not high fees and has return potential. Many 401ks offer like 2 usual funds and then 10 of their own bs ""products"" that just grab fees.


* Put that 12k emergency fund into a federally protected high yield savings. Its same peotection as your regular savings account but higher returns. Vanguard has a good option for that, called Vanguard Cash or smth. 


* For the 3k I would put 1k into your brokerage settlement account/money market fund which acts like a savings avcount but has slightly higher returns.

I suggest reading a couple books to learn more about investing. “The Simple Path to Wealth” and “The Little Book of Common Sense Investing” are a great start and would give you a solid foundation.

VOO is a great pick, but gold and dividends, not so much. Look into the 3 fund portfolio - US stocks + International Stocks + Bonds. Stocks are an inflation hedge and bonds are a deflation hedge. Your stock to bond ratio is determined by your risk tolerance. With 30 years to go, you don’t need to be super conservative. An example of this portfolio would be VTI (or VOO) + VXUS + BND or VT + BND.

Gold is a speculative pick. Consider the greater fool theory where you buy it in hopes that someone will at you more for it later down the line. Gold itself doesn’t actually return value like stocks where they appreciate in value due to earnings and dividends. If you want to add a speculative asset like gold, only allocate 5-10% of your portfolio to it.

SCHD is popular right now, but with 30 years to go, I wouldn’t focus on dividends, but if you do hold this, consider it part of your US allocation.

Also should I allocate my own percentage to small caps and international?,n6zihli,"You'll have to assess your risk tolerance and current needs vs what you may need 40 years from now.  In my opinion, having your core retirement accounts set to a moderate to low risk growth level is appropriate since you're young BUT, once you max out your Roth's, open multiple accounts for varying goals.  

I have an income account, a speculative account, 2 Roth retirement accounts, an education account for my kids, a savings account, an emergency account, a checking account and investment savings account plus my wife's accounts.  Some may see this as too much diversification.  I see it as a back up to a back up to a back up.  The main driver for all of these accounts getting larger is active income.  It is necessary for the majority of people to build wealth over time.  As time goes on, the investments build the wealth faster and faster.  Once you get to a point that your $2,500  in dividends (whether from mild dividends security investing or high yielders) surpass your expenses, I'd consider switching to living off of dividends and using your $2,600+/mo income to invest and accelerate the gains.  

It took years of making mistakes but I think that having investments that produce double my salary now was well worth it.

Broad,Investing,1mgptgy,Wealthfront Aggressive Portfolio vs. DIY VOO - is global diversification and tax-loss harvesting really worth it?,n6qx1c1,">Wealthfront Aggressive Portfolio vs. DIY VOO - is global diversification and tax-loss harvesting really worth it? 

Global is, yes.

US only is single country risk, which is an *uncompensated* risk. An uncompensated risk is one that doesn't bring higher expected long term returns. Uncompensated risk should be avoided whenever possible. Compensated vs uncompensated risk:

* https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/

* https://www.northerntrust.com/middle-east/insights-research/2024/wealth-management/compensated-portfolio-risk
>But not all risks are compensated with an expected return premium.

* https://www.pwlcapital.com/is-investing-risky-yes-and-no/ (Bold mine)
>Uncompensated risk is very different; it is the risk specific to an individual company, sector, **or country.**

.

>Global diversification: Is the academic case (“don’t bet it all on one country”) still compelling in a world where the US dominates tech and profits? 

Yes, because what is true now may not be true even 2 years from now. We have decades and centuries of history showing that winners don't stay winners forever.

And what about this:
* The US was only the 4th best developed country to invest in from 2001-2020, 5th if you include Hong Kong: https://www.evidenceinvestor.com/which-country-will-outperform-next-is-irrelevant/ (archive link: https://web.archive.org/web/20240527200134/https://www.evidenceinvestor.com/which-country-will-outperform-next-is-irrelevant/) or shifting that to 2002-2021 drops the US to 6th (and a proper 6th this time, as Hong Kong dropped further, to 10th): https://www.saltmarshcpa.com/cpa-news/blog/which_country_will_outperform__here_s_why_it_shouldn_t_matte.asp or if that doesn’t work: https://web.archive.org/web/20250422033628/https://www.saltmarshcpa.com/cpa-news/blog/which_country_will_outperform__here_s_why_it_shouldn_t_matte.asp

In fact, there's cases to be made for better expected future returns outside the US than inside. Two of which I can think of off the top of my head, one permanent, one temporary.

Permanent: Emerging markets. This should be considered a compensated risk, as they're inherently riskier than developed markets.

Temporary: Valuations. I'll let these explain: Ex-US out performance predicted over the next decade or so. **Even if they’re wrong, you should at least understand where they’re coming from**:

* https://www.morningstar.com/portfolios/experts-forecast-stock-bond-returns-2025-edition

* The last decade+ of US out performance was mostly just the US getting more expensive, not US companies being much better than foreign companies: https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/The-Long-Run-Is-Lying-to-You (click through to the full version)

>5-year total returns (to July 2025)

>Wealthfront Aggressive: ~60 %

>S&P 500 / VOO: ~103 %

>That’s a 40+ percentage-point gap, and it has me questioning whether the extra diversification is actually paying off - or if I’m just paying for under-performance.

That said, since you’re also thinking about medium-term goals like a wedding or car in the next 2–3 years, it makes sense to be more cautious with that portion. Stocks can drop fast, and short-term money shouldn’t be exposed to that kind of risk.

Am I missing something?",n5sog0x,"You're absolutely correct in your assessment. Most people who are about to retire started learning / investing in Markets in or around the mid to early 80s (if they're lucky). Their entire lifetime the entire market was an inverse function of this chart (click ""All"" to go to the timeframe of 40+ years)

[https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y)

On top of that we had massive globalisation, reduction of trade barriers and a huge amount of money creation (which directly influences the 10y treasury note). 

Now most people tell you to just buy and hold. If someone had told you that for example in the time period between 1968-1982 or thereabouts, you would have been fucked. Most people will downvote me for this and most people ( I mean just read the comments here ) believe markets only go up. They will be in for a rude awakening over a timeframe of around 10-20 years. 

Fact of the matter is valuations have been expanding through tariffs, multiple wars, a pandemic, trade restrictions and increasing global tension. This is mostly due to the fact that still, the monetary base is expanding with spending bills and also the chinese effectively doing massive QE. 

Looking ahead around 5-10 years, I call complete and utter bullshit on this market. I wouldnt buy an ETF if my life depended on it at the moment. The next cycle will be led by industrials, miners, anything that gets food or raw materials out of the ground. The past 40 years were a consumer led cycle with consumerism being the leading religion throughout the west. The consumers ability to spend isn't improving anymore. 

The fat lady is already on stage she just hasn't started singing yet. Noone can say if that will be this year, next year or in 3 years. However you won't see gains over a long timeframe the way others have in your lifetime. whats coming next will be more like the 70 where active fund- and investment management would have made sense. 

If you had bought the S&P500 on 24th March 2000, you would have had to wait until March 2013 until they would have broken even. All these smartasses here talking about ETFs are all in their 30s and started working in the early 2010s and experienced nothing but markets going up. 

I can't force anyone to listen to me and most people will shrug or wave me off but the relationship of money gets cheaper, so asset prices go up and then the inverse also being true when money gets more expensive (paradigm we're in now) asset prices constrict is pretty much a law of nature. 

You can not rely on broad based ETFs to secure your retirement the way that people who retire now once could! You need to get smart about your money!

But you need to show what buying and holding would do in the same timeframe.

Edit: I found an old summary I made just looking at charts, the golden/death cross strategy:

* Lost money in the July 1998 drop (sold low to buy high)
* Made money in Aug 2000 by selling then and rebuying around June 2003 - missed a 3 year drop full of fake pumps and dead cat bounces that lasted years
   * caveat: did not assume money in MMFs/bonds/HYSA, dividends missed or continuously buying the **3 year** dip
   * the practicality and whether it's realistic to hold cash equivalent for 3 years is unknown
* Made money in a drop around Jan 2008, and rebuying around Jul 2009 - missed a massive drop
* Neutral in 1/1/2009-1/1/2018, holding throughout all dips would likely be more beneficial
* Lost some money in the \~Jan 2019 dip (crash?) by missing the dip but buying higher
* Lost money in the covid-19 dip by, again, missing the dip buy buying higher
* Made some little money in 2022 by getting out early and high (by luck? Mar 2022) and rebuying fairly low in Feb 2023

In order to be a ""family office"" you need to have a company.

A hedge fund is a type of fund that caters only to qualified and accredited investors.

There are plenty of ""hedge funds"" that have under $10M in assets. And there are plenty of ""retail investors"" that have more than $100M in assets.

The goal of family offices and *most* large hedge funds is not primarily returns but to dampen volatility and to beat inflation.

That said, you've effectively been timing the market keeping your money in cash, and now you are looking to invest that cash into a significantly overbought market. Not that it cannot keep going higher, but we will have a pullback at some point, and more than likely we will see levels below where we are today.

So, you need to ask yourself, what is the time frame for your investment, and are you able to withstand short-term losses?

My winners for me are ASTS and RKLB. I would probably DCA in instead of just throwing all your money in at once. That way you can probably catch some dips and lower your average.

Broad,Investing,1m8cbuc,Roth: focus on ETF or Mutual funds?,n4y4hcj,"The good news is that for a long-term investor in a Roth IRA, the **ETF vs. Mutual Fund** debate is far less important than your actual asset allocation. In many cases (like at Vanguard), they are just different wrappers for the exact same underlying assets.

Crucially, because you're in a Roth, the biggest historical advantage of ETFs—their superior tax efficiency in a *taxable* account—is **completely irrelevant**. All your growth is tax-free anyway.

The choice really comes down to practical differences and investing behavior. Here’s a simple breakdown:

**Choose Mutual Funds if:**

* **You want to AUTOMATE everything.** This is their superpower. You can set up recurring investments like ""$500 on the 1st of every month"" and never have to think about it again. It puts your wealth-building on autopilot.
* **You want to invest exact dollar amounts.** You can invest precisely $100.00, ensuring all your money goes to work immediately without any leftover cash.
* **You want to be protected from your own worst instincts.** Mutual funds only trade once per day at the closing price. This is a feature, not a bug, as it prevents you from panic-selling in the middle of a volatile day.

**Choose ETFs if:**

* **You want the flexibility to trade like a stock.** You can buy or sell any time the market is open and use more advanced order types like limit orders.
* **The ETF version has a significantly lower expense ratio.** For major index funds, this gap has mostly disappeared (e.g., Vanguard's `$VTI` ETF and `$VTSAX` mutual fund have nearly identical fees), but it's worth checking.
* **Your broker offers commission-free ETFs but charges for the mutual funds you want.** This is less common now with major brokers like Fidelity, Vanguard, and Schwab, but it can be a factor.

**The Bottom Line:**

For 99% of people focused on long-term, ""set it and forget it"" wealth building in a Roth, the ability to **auto-invest into a low-cost index mutual fund** is the single biggest advantage. It automates good behavior.

* At **Fidelity**, this would be a fund like `$FSKAX` (Total Market Index).
* At **Vanguard**, this would be `$VTSAX` (Total Stock Market Index).

You truly can't go wrong with the ETF equivalents (`$ITOT` or `$VTI`) either. Don't let this decision paralyze you. The most important step is to pick one and start investing consistently.",1753382087.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1m8cbuc/roth_focus_on_etf_or_mutual_funds/n4y4hcj/

Broad,Investing,1m87ev3,Getting RSUs from my company,n4x5hpk,"A lot will depend on any limitations attached to the grants. Some RSU programs have mandatory hold times, some don't. I've personally never seen a program that didn't, but I've been told that it's possible. There may be other restrictions.

If your RSU program is typical, you'll be getting some portion of your overall grant over the grant period. For example, my current and last companies give grants that vest over 4 years, getting 1/16 of the grant every quarter.

My current company's stock is in solid growth with great long term prospects - we're not a FAANG, but every FAANG uses our products along with about 80% of the Fortune 100. So my company's stock is a good investment. My oldest un-sold RSU stock is from about 4 years ago, when it was $400, this week it's over $1000.

Personally, I hold my RSUs at least until they fall into long term capital gains. Additionally, I started by holding my initially granted stock until my company stock became a concentration (>= 5% of my portfolio). At that point I started selling enough stock to control my concentration so that I can diversify.

Now that company stock is around 5% of my portfolio, I need to do ""rolling sales"" every quarter to keep my concentration at <5% as RSU stock vests every quarter.

For example, every quarter, I sell enough of my oldest company stock to match whatever stock just vested.

So, if $65K of stock grants ""land"" in this quarter, I sell about $65K of my oldest company stock, and then use the proceeds to diversify. Next week I'm selling about that much stock, taking the long term capital gains, and reinvesting in some more conservative (vs growth) investments (not tech, since I'm already over-weighted there, and I work in tech).

Sometimes holding the shares for a years can be very profitable if the company does well. Many just sell the shares for extra income and spend it.  Others will invest the shares.

The goal of an efficient portfolio is not to chase the biggest return but to get the best risk adjusted return. Global diversification lowers risk without giving up much growth, so your money compounds more smoothly over time.

Being slightly overweight alright though as in your home market, like U.S. stocks, can still help as it can lower currency risk, make taxes and costs simpler, and make it easier to stick with your plan.

Thats why i always bring up small cap value stocks to supercharge Portfolios with extra, almost guaranteed better returns.

Small cap value stocks help boost returns because they capture risk factors that the market rewards over time. Following the Fama and French research, smaller and cheaper companies have higher expected returns since they are riskier and often overlooked.

VT gives you the global market, and small cap value adds extra exposure to the size and value factors. Together, they create a more efficient mix with higher long term growth and better risk adjusted returns than the total market alone.",1761714388.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1oiundh/etfs_vooqual/nlyjert/

You would then have a portfolio of:

30% VOO  
15% SPMO  
10% AVUV  
10% AVDV  
10% AVEM  
20% SCHF  
5% IBIT

I actually am not a big fan of SPMO despite recent strong returns since a lot of that came from big tech/AI stocks (like Nvidia), SPMO increases concentration risk and is more susceptible in a market drawdown. If you want to concentrate on the momentum factor, XMMO is another ETF (Invesco MidCap Momentum) which would diversify your portfolio and still concentrate on the momentum factor at the same time. You could go 40% VOO and 5% XMMO.

Anyway, the above is a variation of your portfolio that I think is better diversified and would have higher long-term expected returns.

VTI = Large/Mid and Small cap USA (roughly 80% large, 20% mid and small)

VXUS = International Non-US (includes china/india)

VEA = International Non-Us developed (excludes china/india)

You can go super simple and invest it all in VT (currently roughly 60% USA / 40% interntional)

You can keep going with VTI/VOO (VTI/VOO returns are slightly better towards VOO but VTI is more diversified than VOO)

I'd personally replace VXUS with a mix of AVIV/AVDV but even AVNM is gonna be better. The reason being that Avantis funds are just superior to Vanguard.

Developed international large growth is just something I avoid. You never know what will happen in the future but for the foreseeable European tech companies are way overvalued for their future growth potential unlike us tech companies. Also international growth is too correlated to the us market. During the lost decade international growth did just as bad as us large growth, but international value did really well. I really only invest in international (outside of emerging markets) just in case there’s another big tech crash. Also why I have a big chunk in small cap value and mid caps. 

I really like the idea of half small cap value and half large cap growth for us market. Historically those two categories outperform, yet no clue which will perform better in the future. Large growth beats large value when large caps do well and small cap value beats large cap value when value does well, at least it has every year for the past 53 years. I’d probably do 50% large growth, 25% small value, 25% international value if I did that though.

Slight issue with that is that even though the price of crude is down 14% YTD, Exxon is up over 7% excluding dividends and buybacks. Exxon is 22% of the Vanguard energy fund and CVX is up similarly and it’s 15% of the fund. Nevertheless if we see oil start to go under $50 a barrel I think it’s a worthy place to have some exposure to that most people stay away from. 

Apart from that I like international small cap value, AVDV is the fund for that. Diversity and exposure helps hedge but certainly can impact future performance.

Broad,ETFs,1oe4br1,Global portfolio better than VT/VOO (since 2023-06),nl43zu5,"I like your portfolio suggestion a lot - it’s similar to my own, with a 65/35 global split, tilts towards small cap and value. I don’t use momentum, instead I have slices of tech and large cap growth, but overall performance is similar. I think of this as VT+. It’s market-weighted global coverage, with overweights on the sectors/factors with proven long-term outperformance premiums. I’ve broken my Avantis into just the areas I want it, but your portfolio is very similar as well.

Overall, so long as you hold through the inevitably harder crashes from the momentum (given their intense concentrations in the top performers), you should reliably outperform over long enough time periods.  

For contrast, this is what I’m running, and I plan to happily hold these allocations for the next 35 years.

35% VOO
10% AVUV
10% VGT
10% VUG
15% AVDV
12.5% VXUS
7.5% AVES

My favorite part is that the balance between tech/growth (or your momentum) with the small and value, adding a good chunk of international, is you should have winners from some part of the portfolio no matter how global trends/markets shift. That leads to a real edge during rebalancing, and helps smooth overall portfolio volatility even as the individual sections within are more volatile than a broader index. It’s a nice barbell.

Broad,ETFs,1odsv7i,FBTC worth it?,nkztcjd,"FBTC is an interesting ""existence"" for lack of a better word. If you are at your core a true backer of Bitcoin as a fiat currency and its core principle of decentralized banking, then owning your own BTC and storing it in a cold wallet is what you would do. The problem and risk is, it's not as safe as most investors would like and it's so much harder to manage. There are also tax implications to self custody of BTC.

FBTC kind of veers away from the vision of BTC in that it is controlled by a brokerage, and they are basically giving investors ""slices"" of their bitcoin holdings. The more people buy into those slices, I question whether or not at some point there will be a dilution of spot etf bitcoin. Introduction of spot etfs have affected the value of BTC in that ownership is becoming more accessible and the intrinsic value of owning BTC is affected. This is a debateable topic.

With all this being said, FBTC is so much easier to own. This is because, its secured with the backing of your brokerage, so any fuckups fall back on them, it's value is supposed to track close to what owning real BTC value is, and if you park it on your ROTH IRA, any capital appreciation and growth from your ownership is tax free versus self custody which you will for sure be taxed on.

To make a analogy to the responsibility of things, self custody of BTC is like buying a home. Any issues fall on you, but it's your equity, you have full custody. Also you pay any property tax and you are reponsible for your own security. Owning FBTC is like renting, any issues with your unit, will most likely have to taken cared of by your landlord (your brokerage), security is provided and only if you invest in your ROTH, you don't pay any taxes on the value of your ""ownership"".

It terms of dilution of BTC, BTC has in itself a limited supply of 20 million BTC. Unlike paper money, more can't be printed, and BTC in that regard should be inflation proof, and it's intrinsic value comes from its limited supply. Before the introduction of spot ETFs, you could buy partial pieces of bitcoin, but the value of those partial pieces still tracked directly to the price of one BTC. When spot ETFs where introduced, Fidelity and Blackrock, bought their ""bank"" of BTC and issued and continues to issue shares of their ""bank"" of BTC. So spot ETFS like FBTC first track to their ""bank holdings"" of BTC, which then are to be reflected on the true value of BTC. People who are against spot ETFs, question what is stopping places like Fidelity from overdiluting the shares of their BTC, to meet the demand of spot ETF buyers? It's not like the one controlling the value of BTC is solely its scarcity. Fidelity and Blackrock can now influence by slicing up their ""bank holdings of FBTC"", thus influencing what it truly means to own BTC. This is why hardcore bitcoin believers and crypto heads say self custody in a cold wallet is better. Because your ownership is truly a fiat currency, free from the control of major corporations and their influence. BUT, the amount of security risks come with it pose a challnege.

I do believe in BTC personally, I just wish it was easier to have self custody and I'm on the fence of the introduction of Spot ETFs, specifically with Bitcoin. It's like having the original Jordan AF1s versus a company that owns an original Jordan AF1 saying you get partial ownership to their original Jordan AF1s and the more people that buy into ownership, the smaller your slice of their Jordan AF1 becomes (potential stock splits) but your value goes higher still. Maybe I'm wrong though. That's just the way I see it. I digress.",1761241561.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1odsv7i/fbtc_worth_it/nkztcjd/

Broad,ETFs,1oddvab,ETFs Split,nkx6yyv,"Hey, thanks for posting and looking to improve your investments! I’ll try to summarize what you currently to have, and a few ways to simplify and diversify. 

Your 40% VOO is a strong, solid core of the SP500.  I’d leave that be. 

Your SCHG and VONG are doing the exact same thing, just different tickers. That is 24% large cap growth, which overlaps heavily with your sp500.  I’d just pick one fund, and also shed a bit of these allocations to diversify per below. 

SPMO - momentum tilt, that will also have overlap with sp500 but at least a different methodology. If you believe in momentum, keep this 10%. Otherwise, I’d add this to the VXF described below.

SCHD - if dividends are important to you now, fine to keep this. But if you don’t need income now, better off dumping this for other funds, per below. Or, swap this for some bonds for ‘stability’ if you need it, as you’re 12 years out. 10% bonds won’t cut your growth by that much, but will improve your risk adjusted returns (and can you take a 30% market crash when you are five or six years away from retirement?)

VT - VT is about 60% US, 40% international. So you have 6% in VT, which makes entire portfolio coverage about 2% international. That also gives you about 1% u.s. coverage outside the sp500, which is less than you want for diversification and to capture small and mid cap growth. 

To improve, keeping your sp500 core, growth and momentum preferences, but improving your international, I’d suggest the following: 40% sp500, 10% SCHG, 10% SPMO, 10% VXF (full U.S. market, make this 20% if you dump SPMO, which would get you closer to actual market weights for the U.S. market) 10% SCHD (or bond fund), and 20% VXUS. 

((In my own portfolio, I like the small cap value premium, so I use AVUV and AVDV. However, with a 12 year timeframe, I’d avoid those, and stick with broader market funds like VXUS and VFX)

VOO = US Top 500 ONLY out of which MAG7 make up 35%+ weighting which is ridiculously high concentration.

VTI + VXUS = VT but gives you more control on ExUS allocation.

Growth doesn’t mean high CAGR, it just means that companies are expected to grow at faster pace but it doesn’t guarantee that they will continue to grow forever.

Dividends maybe helpful to you @ 50 but it will curtail your total returns since dividends are not free money at the end of the day.

Broad,ETFs,1ocwcmy,Roth at 23,nkpxz0l,"SPY and VOO are the same thing, the S&P 500 index, but VOO has a cheaper expense ratio. VT is the whole worldwide market. The S&P 500 makes up about 52% of VT. 

At your age, contributing to a Roth IRA and/or Roth 401(k) (you didn't specify which) is just likely the best nice because you'll likely be in a higher tax bracket in the future as you wish your way up the job ladder and increase pay. 

It's generally recommended to switch from Roth to traditional contributions when you're at the highest tax bracket you'll likely be in, as then you'll maximize your tax deduction and people generally spend less, and therefore need less income, during retirement so they'll have a lower tax bracket in retirement. 

Consider 100% VT for maximum global stock diversification with a very low expense ratio. (Or 60-65% VTI + 35-40% VXUS in a taxable account, equivalent to VT but you can claim the foreign tax credit on your taxes.)

Here’s how you could think about it:
	•	If you want simplicity: Just pick one broad fund like VOO (S&P 500) or VT (global diversification).
	•	If you want a mix: Something like 70% VOO + 30% VT gives you strong US exposure with some international balance.
	•	Avoid frequent trading: The key is consistency — contribute regularly and let compounding do the heavy lifting.

ballpark:

* federal long-term capital gains: 15% (if you're under \~$500k income)
* NY state: \~6.85%
* total: \~21.85% on gains

so if you bought in at $120k and it's now $200k, that’s $80k in gains

Unlike some states, New York does have a tax on LTCG. States sometimes will consider you in a different bracket because of not considering federal deductions.

Be aware that this comes *after* other income, so you only get that $45k free if it's your only income for a year. 

Be aware that the taxes only apply to your gains. So if you paid $100k for that VT which is now worth $200k, you only pay taxes on $100k (the gain). 

So, again, depending on your other income, you can reduce the tax hit by selling your ETFs in tranches. If it was your only income, you could realize $200k paying no federal income tax if you spread out the sale over five years.

Broad,ETFs,1oc0da0,38M Investment Strategy,nkk1zve,"People are going crazy for gold right now due to its recent performance, but you might want to do some reading on gold. It's a highly speculative investment and most people don't hold more than 5-10% of it. I personally prefer closer to 15-20% mixed with other uncorrelated assets.

Gold is not a growth engine or wealth builder. It has been doing amazingly well over the last few years but this is the exception, not the norm. Historically gold averages about 4% per year, just slightly above inflation, which makes it a good store of value as a hedge against inflation. It's a great diversifier because it is uncorrelated from stocks, so when stocks drop gold tends to do well. It's also good during crisis, political turmoil and during currency debasement... Like right now. However, it can also go flat (no/slow growth) for long periods, like decades, before proving its worth again. So it takes conviction to hold it for the long haul.

Broad,ETFs,1obtasb,"Why does everyone swear by VT for diversification, when backtests show VTI or VOO perform better over 15 years?",nkqxtsb,"If you expect something to be more stable, less volatile, and more balanced long-term (that is also tax efficient) that should stay in your taxable. Greater odds the money would be there if you need it, and historically VT has less severe drawdowns than a growth or tech fund like VUG or VGT.   Keep growth funds in your IRA, where it is sheltered, and you can rebalance much easier. VT will do all the rebalancing for you, so also no worries for tax drag. 

If you can handle a few extra funds, depending on your belief in the research, expected (and historical) returns for internal small cap value (like AVDV), and emerging markets (AVES) significantly outperform a ‘total’ international like VXUS (or the international slice you’d get with VT). So, worth considering slicing and dicing your international segment - part VXUS (for broad stability and exposure) AVDV (higher risk higher reward SCV, and some emerging market for long term outperformance.  

Granted, if you do slice international for those tilts, it is no longer tax efficient, and would then be better in a tax advantaged account.  So, you could keep your broad U.S. market (or sp500), as well as VXUS, in your taxable, and then keep your higher growth, higher volatility tilts/sectors (VUG, AVDV, emerging markets) in your IRA for shielded tax drag, and for expected outperformance. 

For what it’s worth, I believe the research, have the timeframe, and accept the volatility and higher risk of periodic underperformance, so I use the following allocations, which are backtested and anticipated to well outperform both VT and VOO over a 35 year timeframe:  

U.S. S&P 500

We all never we're taught this is school, so i feel we are all in the same boat. So i'm invested in FSPGX which is very similar to VUG so I'm right there with you. I do think large cap growth is still and will always be a solid long term holding (better than QQQ or QQQM). Large cap growth will cleanse itself over time anyway and it isn't sector cycle dependent like VGT or FTEC would be. Additionally, I believe since we both have 20-30 years to invest, large cap growth will be worth holding for a minimum 20 years since we both should be looking to maximize our capital gains in our youth. Tech sector ETFS like VGT and FTEC are better tech plays than SMH or SMHX since they are more diversified. I hold FTEC but like a mere 2% lol. I'm way more partial to tech than you are, not because I don't believe in tech, just that i believe more so that we are in a tech bubble and they are very overvalued right now.

If you really want to maximize your earning capital POTENTIAL, what i do is invest in small cap value (AVUV). It's more risky in my opinon than tech but has at least has a statical backing for long term ROI potential greater than the S&P 500. But like i said, its not gonna show its true worth until after a crash and recovery cycle basically.

Lastly, I would go VT and be done with it. International is volatile enough with all the microwars, trade wars, etc. It's hard to fathom being able to thoughtfully rebalance it whilst trying to keep up with international news that may affect the market. VT takes away the stress of it and auto invests your international portion at the best approximate allocation. Basically i believe a modern Boglehead portfolio should have an automatic allocation foundation of VT at a sizable amount and then you sprinkle in whatever sector tilts you believe in.

However, even if bonds continue to underperform, a Global Financial Crisis style event will see long-term US treasury bonds spike and minimize the drawdown of a fund like NTSX vs VTI. (NTSX is likely to outperform VTI over longer time horizons that include several major crashes, rather than over short time periods like several years.)",1761221421.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1oba5cl/for_those_that_have_more_than_5_etfs_what_is_your/nkxzi3h/

Broad,ETFs,1oay0ui,AI bubble,nkgaya1,"There is a lot more going on with AI than chat gpt, Facebook ad revenue, or iPhone. I happen to have a sort term rental on Airbnb, so I'm familiar with their implication of AI. They are using it to better stream line their business in a lot of different levels. I use it every day so I see how well all their upgrades work, including the more recent AI transition. It's not all black and white, and take some deeper understanding of how the company functions, and the reasons people use it. AI automatically organizes all the photos for each listing and creates a virtual tour by assigning photos to a room. Before host had to this manually and only 20% of the listings did this because the host just didn't have the ability to do it, or may not have even had a lap top to access the editing tools. AI also is taking over parts of their customer service. I also see this with ATT and it's a major impromvent. When there is an outage with fiber optic it its now shows the exact area on a map, states the estimated time to have it restored, and even sends an email. Before only 3 years ago customers had to call customer support and talk to a real person in India, and they would tell you the estimated time to restored and what happened. It's the same with my electric company. The map on the app now gives the exact number and location of each outage. We get hit by hurricanes every year and it shows every single location without power. These are just a few examples that I see every day in use.   
  
Everyone has to invest how they see fit. It's impossible for everyone to have the same strategy as a lot depends on how much money and income someone has, if they are building wealth or trying to preserve it. The amount is the biggest factor. Someone who has 200k in savings in retirement and needs that as part of their retirement may not be able to ride out a downturn invested in SP500 so the risk is too great. But someone with 4M and a 50k a year spend, they can easily ride out any kind of downturn. I also know people with that kind of savings and they would never invest in the stock market and cite the 1929 crash, and would be a total waste of time to convince them otherwise. Now they are also experts at AI and think it will wipe out all the jobs and will be 1929 all over again. 

Other people panic sold in April and bought real estate, or they bought a REIT, 3 years ago and lost money on all of that. Remember when investors couldn't get the money out of the Blockstone REIT. So would have just been so much better off just parking their money in SP500 index fund. As diversification usually means more risk not less.  
  
But if someone shouldn't even be in the stock market there is no point in wringing their hands about AI, taco tweets, the recession that never happened, etc.   
  
I was keeping too much cash in emergency funds and timing wasn't perfect, it never is, but nothing wrong with having more cash on the sidelines if that's where you need to be. I'm employed so I just ride right through any pull backs that are part of it, and if you can't then no one is forcing you to stay invested. However so far in my experience everyone I know who diversifies and has all these other side investments usually chasing profits ends up just reducing their returns. It really depends on how much someone has. Some people are getting old and have earned FU money and are just bored and it won't matter they lose a little here and there.",1760954535.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1oay0ui/ai_bubble/nkgaya1/

I have about 1 percent of my retirement in crypto but okay with it going up to 5 percent. I don’t like precious metals either because there are not any dividends and taxed higher than stocks when selling in brokerage account. Like many said VXUS is a good option but I’m taking a bet in my wife’s Roth IRA that an avantis fund will outperform it so I replaced it with AVNM which is there international equity fund.

So, props for that. But what matters is how well you are doing against YOUR future, not everyone else. You could start with a review your asset allocations. What % of your portfolio is BTC, for example. If you don't have conviction in the BTC narrative (deflationary, scarce, etc.) then consider trimming your exposure but not eliminating it and set some stop losses where you would want to get out, especially if it helps you sleep well. Since you're up, that's not too hard, choose a level that locks in some profit or breakeven but also allows this fairly volatile asset some room to run. Do this for your entire portfolio. As for early retirement, you should spend some time painting that picture in detail. Right now (it may change considerably) what does your ideal early retirement look like? Where would you live? With whom? Do they also have resources and will you share them? Whom might you need to support, e.g. elderly parents or grandkids? Are they all set as of today? What lifestyle would you lead? Lots of travel? Couch surfing or luxury hotels or cruises? Expensive hobbies like cars or more of a reader in a sunlit nook? Health issues now? Likely health issues based on family history? Do you have a will made up? Health directive? Life insurance? To whom are you going to leave all this money if you die tomorrow, in 5 years, 20 years? What if you live to 100? What about setting up a trust? Any charities you want to support? How about a tax strategy, short, mid and long term? How much is all of this going to cost? There are tons of resources with professionals (fee based, not percentage if you are wise) and also lots of free info on YouTube and elsewhere (do your best to find reputable people). Let these thoughts percolate a little and then start setting things up. Check list style. Then git 'r done! Let the big number guide you. Where are you now and where do you likely need to be. How would you get there? Are you putting aside enough? Don't expect a windfall like inheritance. And what if you lost your income to AI or injury? Check in with yourself and your partner, if any, every time period that helps reduce anxiety. Maybe more frequently at first, say monthly for a year to hold yourself accountable on completing the checklist, then reduce to quarterly until you are satisfied with your rate of progress and strategy, then annually as life events happen and you might need to correct course.

Broad,ETFs,1o9v038,Could GDE ETF (SPY + Gold) Be a Perfect Combination?,nk50w1r,"It is a very efficient way to introduce gold to a regularly rebalanced portfolio.

Hold 11.1% GDE for a 10% gold allocation, 22.2% for a 20% gold allocation, all while simultaneously getting equivalent exposure to the S&P500 through direct shares, they dont even take the lazy route of buying another nested S&P500 index fund.

GDE is tax efficient for the exposure it provides, and the cost of leverage is only on the gold futures portion. They direct hold 90% equities and because they go for 90/90 exposure for SPY/Gold, they dont need to take any equity swap exposure. Gold futures leverage is really cheap, especially these days, costs basically the same as the effective fed funds rate if I remember correctly.

And they do this for a shockingly low 0.2 ER.

Broad,ETFs,1o9v038,Could GDE ETF (SPY + Gold) Be a Perfect Combination?,nk55zrm,"It is a great combination. 

Gold is not a safe haven and it is not negatively correlated. Gold has had significant drawdowns just like stocks have. Gold is non correlated and having non correlated assets in your portfolio can reduce risk and improve returns. There are a number of periods of time where gold has out performed stocks. GDE is more tax efficient than holding gold directly because it uses gold futures, which are taxed more favorably than holding gold directly. Gold  has often been flat or up when stocks have been down, but that won't always be the case. 

I think holding GDE for around 20 percent of your portfolio makes a lot of sense. I would also look at RSSX. It is a bit higher risk higher reward as it is 100 percent SP500 plus about 85 percent gold 15 percent Bitcoin.

Not really saying you are wrong either. Depends on your split.

I ran the math on ChatGPT a few weeks ago and considering the FTC and dividend yield being taxed at 15%, it’s like .05% to .10% difference maybe. Actually the worst final after tax dividend yield was the taxable VTI/VXUS. 

I used 62/38 split since that’s what it said was most comparable to 100% VT. 

Now that all said it ran 10,000 deposited into the 4 accounts 10 years ago. Which says your way is correct based on the real world value of the accounts over the last 10 years. But as you said few hundred dollars

Lets compare assume $1000 investment

Portfolio 1:  
100% VT Yield: 1.69% Dividends: $16.9  
total: $16.9

Portfolio 2:  
63% VTI Yield: 1.14% Dividends: 7.18  
37% VXUS Yield: 2.78% Dividends: 10.29  
(same proportion as VT US vs non US)  
total: $17.47

So yes there seems to be slightly more dividends. But I don't think this is because of VXUS. I think this is actually because VTI has a higher yield than VT does on its US investments. This is because VT and VXUS follow FTSE Global Indexes while VTI uses the CRSP US Total Market Index. So this seems like a VTI issue not a VXUS issue. If you didn't want the extra dividends from VTI you could always use a different US total market fund like FSKAX which has a slightly lower yield but is still total market index with an extremely low expense ratio.

Does the US stock market outperforms other markets?

The US stock market has generally outperformed global markets, particularly since the 2008 financial crisis, with the S&P 500 delivering an average annual return of about 10.54% historically, though adjusted for inflation, the real return is closer to 6.68% [1]. Over the past decade, the S&P 500 has averaged about 13.8% annualized returns compared to about 4.9% for global stocks [2]. The US market's outperformance includes a record of consistently beating the rest of the world on rolling 10-year returns, with the US outperforming global markets for 134 consecutive 10-year periods through 2024 [3].

This strong US performance is attributed partly to sectors like Big Tech but also extends beyond sector effects. Despite this dominance, there is discussion about whether this trends will continue or slow down, influenced by factors such as valuation expansion rather than fundamentals [4][5]. Historically, US market ups and downs have been followed by recoveries, supporting long-term growth [1].

In summary, the US stock market is known for its strong historical outperformance compared with international markets, notably since the late 2000s, making it one of the best-performing equity markets globally [6][3][2].

Also I wanna preface it by saying everything you said is correct, especially simply splitting your foreign and domestic into taxable and non taxables for max benefit 

Just that in a 62/38 VTI/VXUS blend which is what equals 100% VT.

You get a better overall yield on your dividends in every other scenario compared to putting them in a taxable brokerage 

Basically yes you get the FTC but you also are taxed on the dividends which eats into the FTC. 

Your blend in a typical brokerage despite getting the FTC gives you the least “after tax dividend yield” at 1.52% - the tax on dividends is outpacing your FTC 

In an IRA you’d get 1.69%, 

In a taxable brokerage which is 100% VT, you get 1.67%

In the IRA it’s 1.96%

Is the juice worth the squeeze? Maybe if you file perfectly and don’t mind the paperwork, but for most it would be easier to just keep it simple 

But to your point, if you ran 100% VXUS in two accounts, one tax sheltered no FTC and one not but with FTC, the latter does indeed win.

Most people don’t think it’s enough though and will try to beat this average, and that’s fine because a semi-passive investor *should* do that imo. 

Like, outweighing tech and US during a decade of outperformance + taking profits from them to rebalance is a super simple and totally viable strategy. You’d be dumb to not capitalize a bit on QQQ or something for a while, but you’d *also* be dumb to totally rely on it forever - this balance is the had part. 

Personally, I do VT and SPMO. Both are proven long term strategies in different ways. I’m fine with the overlap because I prefer this way of outweighing the US instead of constantly having to worry about maintaining some totally arbitrary VTI/VXUS balance.

I believe it is the 3rd & 4th paragraphs under ""Passive Aggressive Investing?"" in: https://www.pwlcapital.com/should-you-invest-in-the-sp-500-index

>and in my humble retail investor opinion if you can't even match the performance of the S&P500 100% of the time then you are not investing wisely

There's plenty of times where the S&P 500 isn't the best cover. Market favor has spent plenty of time outside the US or with smaller US companies. 

Single country risk, which S&P 500 only would be, is an uncompensated risk. An uncompensated risk is one that doesn't bring higher expected long term returns. Uncompensated risk should be avoided whenever possible. Compensated vs uncompensated risk:

* https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/

* https://www.northerntrust.com/middle-east/insights-research/2024/wealth-management/compensated-portfolio-risk
>But not all risks are compensated with an expected return premium.

* https://www.pwlcapital.com/is-investing-risky-yes-and-no/ (Bold mine)
>Uncompensated risk is very different; it is the risk specific to an individual company, sector, **or country.**

.
>I'm ""only"" going to be investing for the next 30-40 years or so, so I have very good confidence and belief in the S&P500 and my ability to weather any and all market downturns in that timeframe, while still being able to capture 100% of the upside swings and bigger gains of the S&P, rather than only about 60% of those gains, as would be the case with VT.

You can't guarantee that the US will continue to be above the ""rest of world"" weighted average over any duration, especially the next 30-40 years.

>I need to maximize my growth and gain potential and I just can't risk underperforming even the S&P500, that would be unthinkable to me.

You can't say work any certainly that the S&P 500 will beat smaller US companies (long term tends to favor small over large) or ex-US. 

100% S&P 500 could easily lose to VT.

The US shouldn't have higher expected returns than other countries, as it doesn't seem to have any compensated risk categories that others don't.

>However, maybe in retirement I could see myself moving a significant amount of money into something like VT to be safer while still getting some growth and dividends, but as of now I'm just not seeing VT for my young age and very long investment horizon.

VT is just as aggressive as VOO, possibly more so (see next section).

>but as of now I'm just not seeing VT for my young age and very long investment horizon. To me, 100% S&P500 is a nice middle ground of risk-reward ratio that sits comfortably in between the higher risk-higher reward QQQ, and the lower risk-lower return VT.

I'd argue that QQQ is not higher risk higher reward when it comes to compensated risks (as defined in the links above) and in fact could be seen as safer. That's also the factor argument that works against QQQ: it currently sits in large cap growth, which long term has had some of the lowest returns (only beating small growth, see CBS link below). Growth has tended to lose to both blend and value in the long run, and small blend and small value have tended to beat large.

I'd also argue that VT's inclusion of smaller caps and emerging markets actually makes it higher risk than S&P 500 while avoiding uncompensated risk of single country.

The US is a developed market, which are safer than emerging markets. Even among developed markets, the US is often seen as particularly safe. Larger caps are safer than smaller caps. The S&P 500 is only US large caps, which is about as safe as you can get (of we ignore uncompensated risks).

I think you're mixing up performance chasing with an actual understanding of risk and reward.

Broad,ETFs,1o8am5d,Thoughts On VT,nk35cls,">One thing that holds me back is that, looking at the charts, SPY has returned over 500% since June 2008 when VT launched while VT only returned a measly 177%

And a longer term view of things would show periods where you'd have seen VOO trailing well behind.

>I don't think that I would be able to make enough money with that kind of number since I don't make a lot of money and typically invest anywhere from only $10-$40 a day on average, aside from when I very rarely dump in $300-$600.

You're trying to use recent past returns and assume those will continue into the future. That's often not the case, as decades and decades of data show, much of which I've linked above.

>I NEED those insane SPY gains if I am to have any shot at retirement. I just don't know if I can trust VT to get me there if it took 17 years to return not enough 2x on investment, and that would be only if you did a huge lump sum in 2008. 

You can't invest for yesterday's returns. You seem to be ignoring data (that I've provided you, can you provide any data showing where mine is wrong?) showing that those great returns from 2008 through now, plus the current valuations, actually suggests the US has lower expected future returns than ex-US.

>but I'm still just not convinced that VT, even being 60% US market cap weighted, will ever produce amazing returns.

Every decade (measured xxx0-xxx9) between 1950 and 1989 (that'[s 4 in a row: 50s, 60s, 70,s 80s) favored ex-US over the US. It could have been very easy to say at points there that the US would never be able to keep up with the rest of the world.

>I think that a lot of what is in the fund keeps it dragged down and stops it from skyrocketing like other funds can.

By diversifying, you can actually expose yourself to more compensated types of risk (small, emerging) compared to a more narrow focus (such as S& 500 only). This can help increase expected future returns. It also helps you avoid being 100% in the losing area, which S& 500 only cannot guarantee.

There's a lot of junk in just about every fund, as I linked above there's only a small number of companies that provide great excess returns. Which companies those are will change from time to time.

> It seems like you either have to have a considerable amount of money to invest in one lump sum to begin with in the hopes that it will 2x+ within 25-30 years, or that it may be better suited for those approaching or in retirement and that are ready to shift a serious amount of money into it in a lump sum for less volatility and for dividends

Stop trying to assume returns between 2008 and today are a good judge of returns from today through 30 years from now. They're not.

A global portfolio can be beneficial to both RETURNS and volatility compared to a US only portfolio in the long run. We've seen that:

It may work out ok, but you're taking on extra risk of a type that doesn't bring higher expected returns (taking on uncompensated risk), ignoring compensated risks, and falling for beginner level mistakes (recency bias/performance chasing/thinking things will continue as they have been).",1760758864.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1o8am5d/thoughts_on_vt/nk35cls/

I would say you struggle to see the appeal of VT because the U.S. has been on absolute BULL RUN for the last 20 years. Correct me if im wrong but we are in the one of the longest if not the longest bull runs the United States has ever had. 

The appeal of diversification and specifically VT is in bear markets and after a bear market cycle. 

VOO doesn't capture mid caps or small caps. Keep in mind VOO is the best for stable earnings but not for earning POTENTIAL. The ceiling for Large Cap 500 is already at an all time high and consistently tries to push for more to meet quarterly expectations to maintain their stock holders. When companies can no longer live up to growth expectations they begin to weaken or have to collaborate or buy up smaller companies. Think of OpenAI and AMD right now. 

However mid caps and most especially small caps have WAY MORE POTENTIAL. They have a higher ceiling to reach than Large cap companies and can be where real investments shine post bear markets. 

Market crashes and bear markets can ""reset"" markets and those that survive the wake of a crash and recover well can make it to the top. That includes small caps and more likely mid cap companies. Large cap companies have limit to what they can grow and reach before crashing out i.e. Enron, Toys R Us, Radioshack, Sears, Kodak, Blockbuster etc. 

If you buy up mid and small caps via VT, you can lessen a blow to market crashes, and bolster your recovery from bear markets. 

All this is hard to fathom because well we haven't had a true crash since maybe 2008. S&P 500 has been killing it for the past almost 20 years so the data suffers from recency bias.",1760649707.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1o86t58/etfs_to_hold_for_another_30_years/njv5qny/

Broad,ETFs,1o86t58,ETFs to hold for another 30 years,njzoimu,"Unfortunately VT and VTWAX are relatively newer funds that dont capture far enough back through a US crash. The Dot Com Crash lasted from 2000-2002 and the financial crisis was from 2007-2009.

My best simulation of this data would be to create a total world market fund split of 60/40 US/ex-US with funds that go back far enough. So I did. I used VTSAX for total US Market and VGTSX for total ex-US market and place that portfolio dating back to 2000 up against SPY.

[https://testfol.io/?s=cHy15uzNU8w](https://testfol.io/?s=cHy15uzNU8w)

from the years 2004-ish through Q2 of 2018 you can see that a total market stock similar to VT would have been beating SPY (VOO). SPY was underperforming an All world portfolio for 14 years. You can also see how being diversified lessened the blow of the US market crashes of 2002-2004 and 2007-2009.

Like i said in my post, all world portfolios and VT which is a 60/40 split will tend to actualize its true appeal in bear markets and right after a bear market cycle. That's why you see ""VT SIM"" pulling ahead of SPY after 2004 and 2009.  In this graph you can also see how the US large cap bull run has been absolutely unprecedented in US history. It wouldn't be too far off to say most investors are too young and thereby pretty disillusioned to the nature of crashes and bear market cycle. Recency bias runs rampant for US ONLY portfolios.

if anyone more experienced than me can come with a better simulation than me pls feel free to do so but VTSAX and VGTSX are the only ones i could find at the moment.

I will also say, if you can stomach a crash and are young enough (24 years and younger) I agree a VOO portfolio right now would do fine but for most investors, VT is a safer bet that doesnt require rebalancing, mitigates crashes and recovers better in most bear market cycles. VOO only require investors to be more adept in their risk tolerance and more attentive to their investment according to their time horizon. for example being the age of 55 and fully 100% VOO would suck if the market crashes and it takes more than a decade to recover like the US from 2003-2018. youre retirement money would be blown to smithereens with no time to recover before that investor is pretty much 70 years old +.",1760716332.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1o86t58/etfs_to_hold_for_another_30_years/njzoimu/

US only is single country risk, which is an *uncompensated* risk. An uncompensated risk is one that doesn't bring higher expected long term returns. Uncompensated risk should be avoided whenever possible. Compensated vs uncompensated risk:

* https://www.pwlcapital.com/is-investing-risky-yes-and-no/ (Bold mine)
>Uncompensated risk is very different; it is the risk specific to an individual company, sector, **or country.**

Consider this: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio The bonds are the part that adjust risk level (if you really can stomach 100% stock, they can even be set to 0%, however not everyone is actually able to tolerate 100% stock). More bonds equals less risk. Alternatively, a target date (index) fund or target allocation (index) fund are effectively the 3 fund concept in a single wrapper, managed for you. They are designed to be ""one and done,"" the only thing you hold. They're fully diversified internally for you. These can be found with expense ratios as low as 0.08%-0.12% for the Fidelity, iShares, Schwab, and Vanguard index based ones.

Premise: Does the US market (eg S&P500) typically see a higher average(mean) annual return compared to the global market?

If no, then obviously the US market is an uncompensated risk and should be globally diversified.

If yes, though, then isn't the higher return in the US market be a worthy long-term compensation for the risk?

When you say ""global beats just U.S. long term"", is that historically accurate and true? Does VT outperform VOO for example? Am I misunderstanding?

Another angle to this is, don't major recessions tend to be global? That is, the 2008 Recession and COVID hit the whole market, right? Is there additional value to diversifying outside of the US if the whole world gets hit by major events like these at the same time?

Total US market(VTI) or S&P index (VOO) are the wise decisions for your core ETF  - I went with VOO. The main reason is because theyre self cleansing. If in 15 years big Pharma or Energy companies made there way into powerhouse positions then VOO would shift itself around to reflect that. but yea i also am not thinking Tech is going to die off in our future.. perhaps there is a tech bubble but I feel pretty strong that the future is all Techy. Maybe house robots.. maybe full adaptation of self drive cars.. who knows. so I do own quite about bit of VGT. I choose to keep it simple though just 3 ETFs with VOO being the heaviest weighted.

Just consider that if you pick a sector ETF like VGT, its possible the sector does bad. VOO and VTI dont pick sectors, they morph into whatever is the best at all times. With VOO/VTI i think its easier to stomache dips or crashes and keep investing whereas if we have a decently long dip in something like VGT are you going to be second guessing the sector, and will you be able to have the discipline to DCA into it?",1760465012.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1o6if1n/beginner_investor_looking_for_advice/njhj9fa/

Broad,ETFs,1o4uqon,I need some advice,njafuy0,"You are essentially asking for permission to attempt to time the market. While you can get lucky, this usually doesn’t work out that well. The issue is two fold:

.

* it is very hard to buy in at the right time, because the whole market is human psychology stacked on human psychology, you are human, and the right time is literally when you and everyone else is at max fear, you are convinced this time is different and society is going to end, and you’ll need every last dollar to survive the coming storm.

* You honestly don’t know if this crash is coming next week or in 5 years. If it is the latter, the right time to buy in is probably now and just ride it through the storm. It may be cheaper now than it will be at the bottom of the crash.

.

For this reason, the safe and sane way to do this is to dollar cost average your investment into the market over a period of time. If it does crash, you’ll be buying some of your shares cheap. I’d save back enough cash in a high yield savings account to support yourself for 6-18 months, however long you think it will take to find a new job in a down market if you are laid off.

FWIW, GDP is calculated as a bunch of purchasing and other positive stuff minus imports. Imports have been way down lately because of the tariffs. This makes GDP look like it is growing due to that minus sign. However, if we remove imports from the picture, the rest of the economy has actually been contracting for the last 6 months, which technically would mean we are already in recession. There was a nice story in Fortune recently about how NVIDIA has been paying its AI customers to buy its products. Essentially the company is giving away its most expensive products for free (in exchange for equity) but because of the way it was done gets to mark it as a full sale + profit. This practice is very common in major crashes. Risky times!

Speaking though as a veteran of every crash since before the .com bust, it is totally fine to just ride the market down and back up again. You only get into trouble if you panic and sell — usually this ends in buy high, sell low — or delaying too long to buy in because you think it will be doom and gloom forever. There are some still waiting for 2008 to be over so they can buy in cheap.  You should expect at least a half dozen of these things over your investment time frame. Best to get used to it now. If you DCA in and never sell, it is only the last crash that is going to cause trouble for you.

Don’t over think it. Do keep a healthy rainy day fund. 6-18 months expenses, the time it takes to find a new job.",1760370392.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1o4uqon/i_need_some_advice/njafuy0/

The biggest danger or concern about VOO is the relative lack of diversity at the moment with a handful of companies making up the majority of the value of the S&P 500.

It is what it is and it isn’t inherently bad, but it increases risk, particularly over a short time horizon like 10-15 years that you seem to be focused on.

By adding QQQM you’re doubling down on the riskiest and most thinly stretched pieces of VOO. You’re not diversifying, you’re doing the exact opposite be doubling down on, basically the most expensive components of VOO.

If you want ETFs that pair well with VOO, I’d look at VB, VO, VXUS, BND, REITs, RSP, buying treasuries, and possible physical real estate.

If you’ve got a longer timeline I’d say do t worry about it as much. But if you’re looking to live off of your investments (IE financial independence/FIRE) in less than 20 years you need to be significantly more conservative.

I’m 41 and I’m still 100% equities but I don’t plan to retire until 65-70 years old so I’m not even gonna start with bonds until age 50.

The tax situation doesn't matter at all, especially for a non ""dividend"" focused ETF (at which point, again, there is no difference between pre and post tax).

- read the fact sheet from the provider, which can explain the goals or strategy of the ETF. 

- you can use this link to compare overlap in ETF holdings: https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php for example, VOO and IVV both track the S&P 500 so their performance should be very similar over the long-term and they share 99% of the same stocks. but QQQ and VGT have less in common so are similar but not identical.

More importantly, how are you splitting that money up?  Or are you putting it all into a taxable brokerage account?  If so, are you contributing *other* money to retirement (401k/IRA)?  If not, you should consider splitting your $4k per month up.  

* First, contribute at least enough to your 401k to max out the employer match.  That's 100% risk-free return on your investment.  Not taking it is just letting your employer keep part of your salary.  
* Next, max out a Roth IRA.  In 2025 the contribution limit is $7,000 annually, so $583.33 per month.  
* Finally, whatever's left should be split up as you deem appropriate between your 401k (for long-term retirement savings) and a taxable brokerage account (for medium-term savings for big future purchases like a down payment on a home, your next vehicle, home updates and repairs, etc.)  How you split it up is really up to you, and how you want to prioritize big retirement savings vs. your other financial/life goals, but you should always be contributing *something* to both.",1760016448.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1o0vgqs/4000month_into_voo_too_much_should_i_diversify/nild6u4/

Also look at benefit of SEP IRA if not already pursuing and you're able to on your W2.  If you're fully 1099; consider creating your own LLC that can employ you with a W2 for purpose of tax advantage; if it's advantageous.    You can look into splitting that $4k/month ($48k/year) between retirement and non-retirement as you're able.  Inside retirement, you can trade/buy/sell without paying on the gains.

If this is a long-play, $4k/month over 20 years and averaging 9% will land you around $2.5M.  VOO may reasonably deliver this, based on history.

If you want to ""set it and forget it"", a VOO choice makes it easy... it'll swing with the economy and generally grow.  SCHG is a bit more growth-leaning large cap with a smaller number of holdings.  If you wanted to throw in international, ok.

If you've held it for over a year (long term) that would be $48,000 or less. If you've held it less than a year (short term) that would be $15,000 or less. So it's possible that you could pay less tax if you wait until you've held it for at least a year.

Broad,ETFs,1o037gc,30/30/30/10,ni9etp1,"""Conventional wisdom"" was built upon decades-long period of falling rates from the post-Volcker era of 1981's peak of 19% to 2010's trough of 0%. Those thirty years of consistently falling rates meant that bond values had positive returns, due to the inverse relationship of the bond's rate to its value. But post-2010 bond performance has been anemic due to increasing rates. 

Using Vanguard's Bond Index Fund (VBMFX), compare [1986 to 2010 bond performance](https://testfol.io/?s=gON9tkTRF7w) to [2010 to present](https://testfol.io/?s=2HIOFKmDTnA). It's a night and day difference.

We would need another *significant* spike of rates in order to lead to prolonged falling rates and increasing bond values to make bonds the reliable asset they were for 30 years. With the headwinds facing the US economy, the likeliest outcome will be increasing long-term rates, which will diminish bond performance over the coming decade. Holding bonds right now would be foolish. If you want an asset diversifier choose something else, like gold.",1759850861.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1o037gc/30303010/ni9etp1/

You’re getting less diversification than you probably think. QQQ would just make the overlap worse. DCA’ing daily is fine if it helps you stay consistent, but don’t overthink the timing.

Broad,ETFs,1nzm6ps,Am I investing in any redundant etfs?,ni39lwc,"- QQQ & QQQM: Owning both QQQ and QQQM provides almost perfect redundancy. You are essentially holding the same basket of 100 stocks twice. It's generally recommended to choose one or the other, typically QQQM for long-term holding due to its slightly lower expense ratio.
- QQQ/QQQM & VOO: There is significant overlap here, especially among the top holdings. Many of the largest tech companies (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, NVIDIA) are top components in both Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500. While the S&P 500 diversifies across more sectors, QQQ/QQQM provides a heavier tilt towards tech and growth.
QQQ/QQQM, VOO & VTI: VTI is the broadest US equity market exposure you have. It contains all the stocks found in VOO and most of the stocks found in QQQ/QQQM. If your goal is broad US market exposure, VTI already covers much of what the other two offer. Owning all three creates an overweighting towards large-cap growth/tech, which may or may not be your intentional strategy.",1759767082.0,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1nzm6ps/am_i_investing_in_any_redundant_etfs/ni39lwc/
Broad,ETFs,1nzm6ps,Am I investing in any redundant etfs?,ni3u919,"All of the holdings/companies inside VOO are also in VTI.

QQQ companies are inside VOO and VTI but the weightings are different. 

QQQ is tech heavy which is ok if you think Tech will do well in the long term.   

When you hold all 3 funds you create what’s called “uncompensated risk” 

Take a look at the article attached to understand that concept a little better.  

https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/  

VOO holds mostly large cap companies the big boys but VTI gives you large, mid and small cap companies so it’s more diversified. Both happen to be great funds imo.

To keep things simple it can be better to just hold VTI and contribute as much as you can to that fund. It gives you the most diversification of US companies meaning you own ALL the companies in the investable US market big and small.

Be careful listening to strangers on the internet and try to do some more research. 

Having some overweighting isn’t the worst thing but it just creates overlap and it isn’t necessary. 

Once you find the ETF or ETF’s that you feel most comfortable with the most important thing is to keep contributing $ to it weekly or monthly if you can.

The U.S. stock market has lagged the international stock market in 5 of the last 7 decades, so it hasn't outperformed traditionally. I will encourage you to read about international diversification [here](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/international-stocks/). 

Just because we have had a tech stock bull run for the last 10-15 years, doesn't mean this is the norm; in fact, I would argue this is more of an anomaly.

Right. Dividend yield is a factor and Quality is a factor also. For positions like SCHY, it's a dividend ETF but you're picking up the Quality factor in how they screen. So there is some overlap.

That sounds very sensible to me and I commend you on your research. You are worried a bit about how you might respond to a crash with SPMO, but you are limiting your SPMO to 10% of your portfolio. It will likely bounce back, and most of your $50k will be unaffected (well, most of your portfolio will also have crashed, but perhaps not as much).   
That said: If investing is intriguing you and you are finding yourself learning (and playing) more than someone who just sets their portfolio and checks it once a year, you might allocate 10% for such explorations and risk-taking (for me, I would take that 10% out of VXUS). You might win, you might lose, but you will not worry that you are losing your shirt - and in three years you may feel like you are a wise investor ready to give advice on investing to strangers on reddit. :)  
You might also want to consider GDE or a gold fund for the scenario of interest rates rising, inflation going up and the stock market going down or staying flat.

Meta, Amazon, Google etc. all had to bend the knee to Trump. It's no longer truly competitive. 
You need the deep pockets to survive, which inherently gives these large cap companies room to run. Even the cost of new H1B Visas are so astronomical that only large cap companies can hire the best and brightest in scale. 


To make it even worse there's so much private venture and VC money floating around that these promising companies don't even need to mess with the SEC regulations required to go public.  Why enter the public market if private funding is plentiful? If you have any sort of solid business model private money will snatch you up. If the business doesn't pan out, they can always go public and bilk retail investors. 


I'm honestly thinking investing in the top 20 tech stocks is the only way to go. It's the whole market right now and might be for years to come.

Broad,ETFs,1nxfpqc,I backtested US Small Cap and Mid cap Vs US Large Cap...,nhn5lu8,"You're on the right track with your assessment, but generally advice on here is about mitigating risk. Over the long term, mid cap and small cap - and as someone said, small value cap - do sometimes outperform large cap; however, they are much more volatile, so you are taking on more risk. 

Small value companies are more likely to fail than the largest companies, as a simple example. As to why they can do better: if they make it, they have more room for growth (a quick example might be capturing a larger % of market share, think of Tesla's early days capturing electric car market).

 VTI is most frequently recommended because it's a total stock index fund, meaning while it holds a lot in the top 500, you get exposure to thousands of stocks, including small and mid cap. For a lot of people, this is a perfectly fine balance to set and forget.

For those more interested in holding an S&P 500 etf like VOO (or maybe only have that option through their work retirement account), they often add a ""tilt"" - putting a small percentage of their funds into a small cap, small value, or mid cap stocks to capture potential disproportionate growth while not risking the bulk of their funds on it.

Every time there is a crash, the small/mid cap basically had vertical drops, while the Large Cap had a steep drop but it's nowhere near as vertical or as steep as small/mid.   Imagine if you bought into small/mid cap in 2019.  Just one year later, you'd have lost your shirt.   That's why we recommend VOO/VTI - it's consistent, safe, and little stress.  Yes, small/mid can give you better return if you stick with it long term but imagine the stress when the broader market tank 40% and your small/mid tank 70%!   Small/mid is not for beginners, that's why we don't recommend it to beginners.   No one has ever said, don't invest in the small/mid cap.  The typical advice is to start at an S&P500 and venture out when you get more knowledge and experience.

Broad,ETFs,1nxfpqc,I backtested US Small Cap and Mid cap Vs US Large Cap...,nhnh2ds,"What you discovered is actually a well-documented historical phenomenon in finance known as the **size premium**. Extensive academic research supports the idea that, over long periods, smaller companies have tended to outperform larger companies.

Firstly, smaller and mid-sized companies are generally less mature than large-cap giants, which gives them more room to grow at a faster rate. Secondly, smaller companies are often more nimble and can be acquisition targets for the big guys, which can cause their stock price to pop. Lastly, Large-cap stocks like those in the S&P 500 (which VOO tracks) are among the most analyzed and followed stocks globally. It’s tough to find an “undiscovered gem.” In the small and mid-cap space, there’s a greater chance for a company to be undervalued and for its potential to be overlooked by the broader market, leading to significant price appreciation as it gets discovered.

So why is everyone recommending VOO? It just boils down to **risk, volatility, and human psychology**. While small/mid-caps have delivered higher returns, that journey has been a LOT bumpier. In a market crash, smaller companies tend to get absolutely hammered compared to the large, stable “blue-chip” companies in the S&P 500. VOO will go down, for sure, but a small-cap index will likely go down much more. You’re 22, so you have 40+ years to invest. The single biggest threat to your long-term returns is not picking the “wrong” fund, it’s panicking during a crash and selling at the bottom. The smoother, less volatile ride of VOO makes it psychologically easier for most people to stick to the plan and stay invested. This is a huge but often underrated factor.

Most importantly, past Performance is absolutely NOT a guarantee. We’ve been in a market cycle where giant U.S. tech companies (the biggest stocks in VOO) have dominated everything. There’s no guarantee the “size premium” will hold up over the next 40 years in the same way it did in the past. Betting on VOO is a simple bet on the 500 biggest, most dominant companies in America continuing to do well. It’s a very safe, simple bet, compared to just betting on mid or small-caps.",1759543292.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1nxfpqc/i_backtested_us_small_cap_and_mid_cap_vs_us_large/nhnh2ds/

Also understand that the long term returns of the Total US Market are very close to that of VOO/VTI, such that which you invest in makes little difference.  

Then you have to work in factors.

But yes, I like the size factor.  My portfolio has long been over weight in SC & MC… but that doesn’t mean it will outperform.

Broad,ETFs,1nxfpqc,I backtested US Small Cap and Mid cap Vs US Large Cap...,nhq04l3,"congratulations! you are thinking independently. 

there are a few things about VOO that need unpacking, so let's separate them one by one

- reddit has made the leap from ""most actively managed US large cap funds can't beat the S&P 500 over the long-term"" (true) to ""**nothing** beats the S&P 500 over the long-term"" (false). depending on the period of time, many things have beaten the S&P 500 over 10+ years: small or mid-cap US stocks, US value stocks, international stocks, bonds, commodities, etc. 

- there's a phenomenon with investing called ""herding"". people are social animals, and we tend to follow what other people around us are doing like a herd of sheep: we get the same trendy hairstyles or clothing, we watch the same trendy TV shows with our friends, and we often buy the same trendy investments. This can be good or bad: over the very long term VOO will probably be OK, but other trendy investments can destroy your wealth (ARK funds, EV or solar energy stocks that imploded)

- another issue is ""recency bias"", where people assume recent good performance of an investment will continue indefinitely into the future. VOO had spectacular performance the last 10 years, but it's a mistake to assume it will continue forever. look up very long-term data on the S&P 500 and it seemed unstoppable in the 1990s ... but then the dot-com crash happened and 3 years in a row deep in the red, and the 2008 crash. the S&P 500 was flat for over a decade. scroll down to ""total annual return (%) history"" https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VFINX/performance/ 

- people also assume recent bad performance will continue, which is why reddit was avoiding international stocks ... but international has performed better than US stocks about 13% so far this year. anyone who kept buying international stocks has seen gigantic gains this year. 

- people often don't understand how averages work in the market. let's assume the S&P 500 has a very long-term annual average of ~8-10% before inflation (which is about accurate).  in reality the S&P 500 has averaged closer to about 15%/year for the past 10 years (before inflation)... what does that tell us about future performance? it tells us we will need to see returns **well below average** sometime in the future, in order to reach long-term average of ~9%. if VOO averages 15%/year for one decade, and 3%/year for the next decade ... that gives us about 9%/year average return for the entire 20 year period, but no single year had a 9% return. younger investors are not prepared for 3%/year average from the S&P 500 until 2036. Lance Roberts at Real Investment Advice made a hypothetical chart for showing how 3% returns for a decade can happen, even when 7 out of 10 years have returns at or above historical averages: https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Average-vs-Annual-Return-Example.png

>This data tells me that I should be investing in mid caps for the most growth potential if im to buy and hold for the next 40+ years.

there's an investor named Larry Swedroe whose recommended portfolio is about 30% small cap value, and 70% intermediate bonds. his data says  this portfolio offers the best risk-adjusted returns. https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/larry-swedroe-portfolio/

small and mid caps are much more volatile but historically have much higher returns, if you ride it out for several decades. this might imply small and mid caps under-performing VOO for 15+ years, and very few investors are that patient. reddit was slobbering over Ben Felix and AVUV for the last few years, but many dropped AVUV like a radioactive dog turd earlier this year when the tariff volatility hit and the ETF had a rough patch.",1759587639.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1nxfpqc/i_backtested_us_small_cap_and_mid_cap_vs_us_large/nhq04l3/

Broad,ETFs,1nwtc7u,Advice For a Beginner,nhs9a0w,"A) best time to enter is yesterday, 2nd best time is today.

B) looks decent enough, you’re going to find people that will tell you that its too much overlapping exposure, overexposed to the tech sector or that you should just be in global equities. That is one perspective and while it is good overall advice there is also nothing wrong with being overweight tech / growth as long as you understand that past performance has no bearing on future results. The one thing I would advise is getting some form of international exposure (I would replace QQQM with VXUS / AVDV in equal proportions but thats just me, QQQM is relatively capital inefficient since its 51% overlapped by weight with VOO and leans tech, growth and large cap without 100% being any one of those things, whereas international will help you in other market regimes that arn’t UA growth dominant). 

C) DCA your money into all of your funds in the portions you predecide on. Decide what your weightings should be in % and purchase based in dollar amounts so u can always make contributions broken down into percentages. Decide whether to quarterly or annually rebalance and either 1 or 4 times a year sell your overweight positions and buy your underweight positions. This will increase capital efficiency and returns over time. 

D) Since you didnt mention this. If this is a brokerage make sure you max out a roth IRA FIRST before making any contributions to a taxable. Your money compounding tax free will be a huge favor to yourself in the long run.",1759612135.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1nwtc7u/advice_for_a_beginner/nhs9a0w/

These have P/E ratios of 12 and 11 respectively, which are fairly cheap compared to say VOO (28), SCHG (36), and QQQM (34).  Frankly I'm a little nervous about how much weight and overlap a few big companies like NVDA have in the large cap funds.  And I figure if interest rates go down more, small caps could benefit more.  International has also seen quite a run this year due to devaluation of the dollar, which would only increase if there are further rate cuts.   For me these are diversification, but then again I only have like 10% VT whereas you have much more VT which is already fairly diversified.

Rollover Ira - total market, some value funds, and hedges. So for me it works out like VT + VTV + AVUV + VGIT + GDX. The reason I hold value is to balance out top heavy VT a bit with underespresented value stocks, and to act as a diversifer away from heavy tech I own elsewhere.

Roth - aggressive growth, as the Roth is the the only account of these 3 that gives tax-free penalty-free growth here. So I only do QQQM, nothing else here.

Taxable Brokerage - single stocks only, a few Mag 7 stocks, ultra high quality long term compounders, a few speculative stocks related to AI, etc, other best in beed compounders... so this looks like MSFT, GOOGL, META, PLTR, NBIS, BMNR, etc

This setup is ultra solid and has good growth characteristics. The Rollover Ira seeks beta, and the Roth and Taxable seek alpha.

All of this CAN be replaced with just VT + BND + single stocks, but with this setup I capture total market, rotation from growth to value, gold upside during inflation, bonds upside during deflation/recession, and strong returns from market-leading compounders...",1759087979.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1nr2zob/advice_on_balancing_portfolios_roth_traditional/ngpc0a6/

Research wise a better way to diversify risks is to build a factor portfolio where you incorporate proven risk factors like: market, size, value, momentum, profitability etc rather than balancing sectors.

Broad,Bogleheads,1oisw4j,"Is ""Manually re balancing"" worth it?",nlzr5xw,"What you're describing (having less-correlated investments in multiple sectors) is ""diversifying"" your portfolio, which should help de-risk your accounts when done effectively. Rebalancing is shifting funds among these holdings to maintain a preferred ratio.  
  
For example, assume my desired portfolio consists of 70% stock funds and 30% bonds. If my stocks have a great year, they grow so much that my account is 80% stocks and 20% bonds, so I would rebalance by selling some of my stocks/stock funds and by bonds/bond funds to return to a 70/30 ratio. 

The art of this process essentially happens in taxable accounts (not your 401k/IRA/403b/HSA/529/etc), where you can sell some of your stocks that have \*lost\* value to offset others you are selling that have gained value. This ""tax loss harvesting"" would reduce your gains and (potentially) allow you to avoid taxes altogether.  If you are doing this in a tax-sheltered account (e.g. 401k), then you do not have to worry about tax loss harvesting because the gains are not taxed at the time they are sold.",1761738945.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1oisw4j/is_manually_re_balancing_worth_it/nlzr5xw/

VOO is an odd choice when you have total market in other places, but it's no big deal as VTI and VOO seem to be highly correlated overall.  

You don't seem to be aiming for a specific US/Intl split, and holding VTWAX allows that to float outside of your control.  I am for approximately global market cap, so I prefer holding VT/VTWAX over splitting into VTI/VXUS

What concerns me here is that you have balances in both traditional IRA and Roth IRA.  

If your salary rises to the point where you would need to do a backdoor Roth contribution, having that trad IRA balance makes you subject to the pro-rata rule and closing off the ability to make those contributions without paying a chunk in unexpected taxes. 

You might consider converting the trad balance to Roth (paying taxes as income), or seeing if you can roll the trad balance into your current 401k/403b if possible.",1761739811.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1oisk4p/too_much_overlap/nlztcia/

Broad,Bogleheads,1oip0zo,Need help to clear up some Investing differences,nlx46z7,"VFIAX, the indexed mutual fund, is the classic way of fully investing an exact dollar amount, like an annual IRA contribution. Fractional shares, automatic investments and redemptions, and so forth, are ""built in to the design"" and have worked for decades. Their main quirk is that each stockbroker has to have an agreement with the mutual fund company in order to allow holding their brand in that brokerage account.

VOO, an ETF, is bought and sold on an exchange, and in the late 2010s and 2020s has had some features bolted on to accommodate by-the-dollar investing and fractional share purchases. There are still a few rough edges, such as when you ACAT transfer between brokers, the fractional share portion can't transfer.

It's kind of like cassette vs. CD; cassettes were naturally shock-resistant in cars and Walkmans while CDs required buffering for skip protection but were newer and higher quality so everyone just dealt with it.

It only changes as you get closer to retirement. The target date fund has a glide path. Per Google AI,  ""Glide Path - The fund follows a predetermined glide path that dictates how the mix of assets changes.""

So basically, the allocation doesn't adjust based on the market. It adjusts based on time to retirement. I'm 38, almost 39 years old. So I'm set to be of retirement age in 25 years (2050). So if I wanted a true set it and forget it fund, I would choose a target date fund 2050. I see from a previous post that you're with fidelity, so I would choose Fidelity Freedom 2050 Fund (FFFHX). Usually TDF's are in increments of 5 years. So if I wanted to go a bit more aggressive I could choose their 2055 or 2060 funds.

It’s like debt repayment. Financially it’s best to attack the highest interest rate debt (factoring in any possible tax deduction/credits) and work your way down. There is also the snowball theory of start with the smallest balance and celebrate the small wins - which is financial suboptimal but makes good psychological sense. 


Dividend investing is more about feeling the small “wins” of payments from investing (dopamine for our brains) and make people feel accomplished and like they did more. Even if that tax drag will hurt total returns. It also helps for people to “set and forget” in retirement. It’s easier to just wait a quarter for a check than chose which date to sell your equities. Some people might panic during volatility or spend too much time poking around. This might actually lower their overall returns. 

The only financial reason I can think of is if you participate in some special tax scheme. For example I have NHR for Portugal. It allows me to pay 0% taxes of dividends where taxes are levied in another country. In my case, the U.S. taxes my dividends, meaning Portugal charges me 0%. I get the tax credit for funds paid to the U.S. to offset my Portuguese tax obligations. 

If I sell stock (capital gains) I pay either normal Portuguese income tax rates (47+%) on short term or 28% long term. I get to credit against my U.S. bill.

Broad,Bogleheads,1ohx4qp,Dividend Gang vs Bogleheads,nlvkrvg,">Through increases in stock price, or if they company get’s liquidated. And stock price is ultimately market sentiment.

But you can create your own dividend by selling shares. For easy math, let's say a company announces their quarterly earning and the EPS is $1. Whether the company pays out $1/share as a dividend, or an investor sells the equivalent number of shares to match that amount, the investor is left in the same position.

Creating your own dividends through selling shares is a superior strategy as it allows the investor to create the exact cashflow they need to match their expenses. An investor shouldn't allow a company's dividend policy to dictate their spending in retirement.

A dividend payment is not additional money in your account, because that money was already priced into the share price. Dividends just convert capital to cash, the same way that selling shares does. All else equal, it's the same thing.

>People can’t count on that in retirement and could be boned in a long bear market.

Dividends do not provide any downside protection in bear markets, people just feel that way because they don't understand where the dividend comes from.

Because dividends come out of the share price, the money received from dividends is no more/less real than share price growth. Dividends and share price are two sides of the same coin, your total return is not impacted by dividends.

>By being less cold and more understanding of people reasons for wanting some dividends. This is all new territory here, and these are genuine concerns. 

They're not genuine concerns though. I get that people are concerned, but those concerns are rooted in a misunderstanding of how dividends work, that's all. We're in new territory of low yields since share buybacks became legal, and this trend will continue which isn't a bad thing. As dividend yields decrease, dividend investors will finally understand that dividends were never relevant to their returns. Or unfortunately some will continue their journey of ignorance and seek higher yields, which we are seeing in the rise of covered call funds.

>People’s worry’s are justified as a long bear market can leave them with both low value stocks and low income.

Those worries can be alleviated by understanding how dividends work, and understanding that they do not protect you in a long bear market. How long an investor's money will last in retirement is a function of two variables: the rate of total return, and the rate of withdrawal. Dividends don't impact the math.

If an investor is worried about running out of money, they should seek to increase their total returns for the level of risk they are taking. Focusing on dividends does not accomplish that goal. The higher total returns an investor can generate, the longer their money will last.",1761677911.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1ohx4qp/dividend_gang_vs_bogleheads/nlvkrvg/

Who cares if a company I hold stock in accumulates value through expansion of their capital assets, profits etc? The stock is worth what the next guy will pay me, regardless of the fundamentals. There's no rule that profitable companies have to have higher stock values. Tesla is a great example - their stock went to the moon before they ever turned a profit. 
Now they're turning a profit. Yay. Is that being shared with investors via dividends? Nope! The value of the stock is coming from the next guy buying, not from the company itself sharing profits.


You might say well these valuations are tied to expectations of future profits. Again, I say so what? Those future profits are not going to be shared. They are going to be reinvested. The tech stocks everyone is buying are the stingiest. Hardly any of them pay much of a dividend. The biggest are now buying stakes *in each other* rather than pay investors a dividend. Yet we keep buying them hand over fist, driving up prices. 

Without a dividend, there is no causal link between a company's high profits and my value, *except what the next guy will pay.* Again, the money is not coming from the company I hold stock in, but from the next guy. That's the definition of speculation.

If you take nothing else away from it:

* If your employer matches some % of your contributions to your retirement accounts, max out your contributions to capture all of the match

* Enjoy your life, but avoid ""lifestyle creep""

* Make consistent contributions to highly-diversified, low expense ratio mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs)

* Abandon the idea that you can pick individual stocks that will outperform a highly-diversified basket of publicly-traded stocks, or ""time"" the market by selling your holdings at the peak / buying in only at the bottom

* Consider investing some 10-20% of your overall investment portfolio in bonds (again through highly-diversified, low expense ratio mutual funds or ETFs) in order to smooth the volatility of your investments in public stocks

* Avoid picking individual stocks or high expense ratio mutual funds at all costs

* Resist the urge to sell off your investments when things inevitably take (even a very large) dip

Since you are very early in your career your time horizon is very long and therefore your risk tolerance for short-term volatility is very high.",1761599945.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1ohkt5a/22yearold_soontobe_nurse_looking_to_start_my/nlpugn9/

EDIT: Buying VTI or VT and holding your VOO etf will create a US Large Cap Portfolio tilt and bias your investments toward the S&P500. This isn't necessarily bad since long term, US Large Cap is still a strong long term investment. I just came back to edit so that you are aware of the implications of not selling and proceeding to purchase VT or VTI. It will create an overlap in the S&P500 thus creating a portfolio tilt. Once again i personally don't think this is a bad thing, but something you should be aware of. 

Portfolio tilts and concentrations in cap range or sectors expose you to more risk in whatever category hold greater weight in concentration.

Check in on it once or twice a year and rebalance as needed.

Without sitting down and doing all the math myself, it’s hard to tell what your US stock/international stock/bond percentages are and what your targets are. Figure out what that is and make sure that AA is met considering ALL of your retirement (+HSA) accounts as a whole. Include taxable if it’s for retirement, but it may have a different AA if it’s for something else.

Broad,Bogleheads,1ogkv8w,BND Alternatives,nlh8vml,"TLDR: Any optimization over BND using something meant to fill the same approximate role will make only a very minor difference.

Government bonds will typically be less correlated to the stock market than corporate bonds, but here's the thing: With an 80/20 portfolio, it hardly matters at all if you choose something other than BND or similar intermediate bond fund. I got into determining the ""best"" bond fund and honestly gave up on finding anything that made a meaningful difference vs BND.

[Here's one example using a 60/40 portfolio](https://testfol.io/?s=k2njmk7j4bH): BND-equivalent funds and treasury-only funds look extremely similar. Over very long time frames (this one is >30 years) short term funds will gradually fall behind; CAGR for the portfolio is slightly lower and that accumulates, but you don't really see much benefit in terms of volatility. Actually, it looks worse in this case, although choice of time frame can swing that one way or another

For long time frames, long-term treasuries can be a good part of a mixed portfolio designed to reduce volatility, but they themselves are very high volatility and those portfolios tend to sacrifice total returns for greater aggregate predictability (see things like The Golden Butterfly).  A lot of high volatility but loosely correlated assets can give downside protection, if you're willing to go that route.

Broad,Bogleheads,1ogkv8w,BND Alternatives,nlh701e,"Let's start with the fact that you don't really want something that is perfectly negatively correlated because that just makes you market neutral and if you're neutral you might as well not be invested and save some expense ratios.

Example - if you go 80% VOO and 20% SH (a S&P Short Fund) then no matter what the market does you are going to end up with 60% of the VOO return.. so you might as well be in 60% VOO and 40% cash. (I presumed that SH is going to give you -1x VOO, but its daily reset leverage and won't do that exactly but lets just use it as a standin for a pure short play). But these investments are indeed inversely correlated when one is up the other is down.

Bonds, at their best, are positive expected return but uncorrelated to stocks. That's the best you're going to be able to do and you really need to take that risk if you want an overall positive expected return.

If you're not happy with taking risk at all, so as to have ballast in your portfolio, then the answer is to have an allocation of things that behave more like cash.. As you move out the risk spectrum from actual cash you get into money markets, floating rate bonds (USFR, TFLO), ultra short bonds (4 week t-bills SGOV), and 2 (UTWO) or 3 (UTRE) year bonds. 

After that point you're taking on meaningful interest rate risk..  we saw a few years ago how that can be correlated with stock prices when rates went up very quickly - growth stocks got hammered and bond prices plummeted as yields went up.  But even then the change in an intermediate term bond fund was waaaaay less than the drop in a tech fund like ARKK, so bonds are still more conservative unless you're talking long term (30, 50, 100 year) bonds.",1761487231.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1ogkv8w/bnd_alternatives/nlh701e/

Relative to inflation, ALL are in the same range, all lost economic value. The time frame is based on the newest, VTABX. 

Yes, a consistent investor in ANY of these funds lost money since 2013, relative to inflation. That what ""costing oneself money"" means.

I couldn't find the number of Fidelity holdings, but the US funds own 11-12,000 bonds, VTABX 6,000. These are broad based funds, meant to replicate the total bond markets. 

Yes, BND only goes down to BBB, but if one wants to hedge stock market risk with junk bonds, good luck with that. And TIPs are simply treasuries, and they perform like treasuries.

Broad,Bogleheads,1ogkv8w,BND Alternatives,nlljkq8,"A Google search I did shows junk bonds represent about 3.6% of the total world bond market. So a fund like BND or BNDW samples around 96 to 97% of the bond market. I'd say that qualifies pretty much as the entire bond market. 

Plus, bonds are pretty much homogeneous. They move pretty much together like the Borg, based on type of asset, credit rating, etc. US and International bonds are going to roughly perform the same, as the portfolio analyzer I ran shows.

The portfolio analyzers go back about 50 years. There have been a handful of ten year periods where the bond performance matched or did slightly better than stocks. To the best of my knowledge--and I [ran the numbers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/18yyw0m/the_case_against_bonds/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and since 1987 there has been no 20 year rolling period when bonds even came close to stocks. Just because people on here say it, it doesn't mean it's true.

The 10 year treasury as of today is about 4%. The YTM of BND is 4.4%. That is your level of expectation of bond performance going forward. If stocks don't do better than 4.4% for the next 10 years, yes, you would have been better off owning bonds, and if that is your expectation, you should be 100% bonds. 

If stocks do better than 4.4%, which history suggests is likely, then virtually ANY amount invested in bonds or bond funds is going to result in lower returns, because you are diluting your returns with a lower performing asset.

Age is only relevant as a stand in for time until you'll start drawdown and that based on a bunch of assumptions. 10% fixed income makes sense at any time as it has a significant impact on volatility and a negligible impact on returns.

It might not sound exciting, but once you learn how favourably capital gains are taxed, you might actually be in for a huge surprise 😁

For example, I'm Canadian. In Canada, we are only taxed on half of our capital gains. So imagine these two hypotheticals:
 
1. An Ontario resident makes $100k a year working a job. They'd pay about $21k in taxes and be left with $79k
2. An Ontario resident sells $100k of stock a year to fund their early retirement. Let's assume they have a $50k capital gain. In Canada, only the capital gain is taxed, and half of that is tax exempt. The rest of the capital gain is treated as income. They end up paying $2k in taxes and are left with $98k, or almost $20k more than the guy actually working for a living

As my portfolio grows over my retirement, my capital gains will also grow. But the taxes owed will always be _at most half_ of what a salaried employee is paying.

Full international meaning 100% international and no US? That would definitely overweight international and be less diverse than something like VT. I don't think very many people are doing this (some people living outside the US invest more in their home country which is fine!).


VT holds both US and international stocks at a market cap ratio. Many bogleheads invest in VT and consider it a good choice.


Historically the US has not had a lower margin of error I don't think? That's a very odd term to use. It has had periods of outperformance, and international has also had periods of outperformance. The US has been doing very well recently, so that does explain why some people invest only in US.


Investing in VOO and VT would overweight the US because VT already includes everything in VOO. Remember that VT is the same as VTI + VXUS, and VTI includes VOO. So there's no need to invest in both.

Broad,Bogleheads,1oehnh3,I have been increasing the size of my emergency fund instead of buying equity. Am I falling back into the cash trap?,nl2ct4e,"I think it's too much but not because I think you're paranoid. There are few people (and nobody on Reddit) that can judge whether you are likely to get a new job in 6, 12, 24... months. There are people near retirement dealing with ageism that might have to change careers before they get a job.

The key is *why* it's 6 months. Some of it is about liquidity but at some point it's about timing. So I don't think of emergency funds as a single thing.

First, my car or furnace explodes and I need to repair it. That's $10k I want to have access to no matter what. HYSA.

Second, I lose my job during an economic downturn and don't want to pull money out of my investments. That's 3-6 months that I can get in a week. SGOV.

Third, I can't find a new job for an extended period of time but thanks to SGOV I can wait for the market not be having its worst month in 5 years. VT in a brokerage account.

Fourth, my entire life craters and I need to rebuild from scratch. That's my retirement account and if I can't find a job for a couple of years, I'll count that as (an early) part of my retirement. VT in an IRA.

Given how you've described yourself it is probably true that you want to save more money than you need to. But a lot of investing is about knowing your tolerances, which makes that a therapist/priest/whatever question, not a financial question.

If it makes you feel better, put 3-12 months in a HYSA and 6-12 months in VT in a *separate* brokerage account. You can look at that account and know that you can always use that money if you need it.",1761271203.0,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1oehnh3/i_have_been_increasing_the_size_of_my_emergency/nl2ct4e/
Broad,Bogleheads,1oehnh3,I have been increasing the size of my emergency fund instead of buying equity. Am I falling back into the cash trap?,nl1ptv3,"You're thinking on the right path. 3 months, 6 months, 12 months. Etc. these are all rules of thumb. The real cause is, as you pointed out, being able to handle the emergency, and that's a thing that is relative to everyone.

For most people, the largest emergency they may face in cash is loss of employment. And depending on what their resume is and the type of work they do, the time for them to get re-employed at a similar level could reasonably vary from a week to a couple years or more.

You know your career field best. Take your best estimate of how long it would take you to get re-employed at similar income and make that your target number of monthly expenses.

You can also, as already mentioned, go over that for peace of mind. You can think of the differential in potential earns as a premium you're paying for  peace of mind. What's the difference of 12 months of expenses from your emergency bucket to your long-term portfolio? Probably less than you think. Do the math though and think about it.

Another angle of attack is this: Lets imagine you are laid off tomorrow. You don't need all 24 months liquid today. You only need a fraction of it today and then another fraction tomorrow, etc. 24 months is a long time to unwind a position. Instead of keeping the whole position liquid, consider keeping a small portion liquid that gives you enough operational time to liquidate the rest without having to do it all at once if it occurs during a market crash or the like.

For example: If I had a theoretical $5k/month expenses, and I want 24 months of savings that's $120k. $120k isn't chump change, so I want to be efficient with it. How do you slice that pie? Probably not 100% into a HYSA.

I might keep $1k in physical cash, accessible for an event where access to my bank may be down: Think local natural disasters. I might keep $9k in a HYSA, where it could be digitally moved to my checking or ACH'd at a moments notice over the internet - that gets me a down payment on a car or a water heater replaced while I am arguing with insurance. I might keep $50k in I-bonds I accrued over the years. I could  walk into a bank with those (if paper) and walk out with cash, in an emergency - but I also get to defer taxes on them unlike an HYSA. I might keep the last 60k in VT, but in a taxable brokerage. If the emergency is equivalent to sub-12 months I don't have to touch this. If I think it might go that long, I've got 12 months to look for an exit point in the market or DCA out of the position. The cost? I lose some tax benefits vs. my retirement account. That's a low cost for the peace of mind.",1761262924.0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1oehnh3/i_have_been_increasing_the_size_of_my_emergency/nl1ptv3/

Boglehead dogma is sort of odd on this. It says that you should not try to time the market when making contributions, but it also says you should time the market by not selling when you need the money in a down market, lol.  Same for distributions in retirement.

It’s further complicated by the fact that for a lot of younger people, long-term investments mean money that’s locked into a 401(k) instead of just in taxable brokerage.

I don't think there's anything wrong with holding such an extensive cash emergency fund as long as:

1. You're not sacrificing free money from your employee match.
2. You're comfortable with the drag on your finances from holding cash.
3. You have a specific reason for 24 months of cash, and aren't just hoarding cash because you will never feel comfortable unless you have more.

\#3 is the one I'm concerned about in your situation, because there's never any end to it. Because you have a 403b and not a 401k, does that mean you're in a highly stable public sector job? In that situation, one would actually be justified in having a shorter, 3-month emergency fund rather than 24 months. Longer emergency funds are typically reserved for people in commissions-based sales jobs, or highly specialized or seasonal work. 

What is the longest you've ever been without a job in your adult life? If you were without work, how much could you cut expenses to stretch things out? How much of a pay cut do you think you could live with if you had to?

I also had/have an outsized emergency fund - once I could “afford” it, my emergency fund would cover a year of expenses easily. I worked for 25 years at a large tech company that had at least 2 very large layoffs every year but also laid people off throughout the year (often immediately replacing them with someone on an H1B Visa after the person had trained them).

I watched so many people struggle to find another job and the older they were (even in their 40’s) the more impossible it seemed for them. I have gotten so many messages on LinkedIn from people in that boat looking for a job who’d been looking for more than a year.

Most of my portfolio was in retirement accounts (traditional 401k) so I never wanted to dip into them if I lost my job - I didn’t focus on investing in a brokerage account until after I had a full year of an emergency fund; now I have a sizable brokerage invested in VTI and VXUS but also my emergency fund in VUSXX.

I’ve worked through the dot com bubble, the financial crisis, etc. and my only fear during those downturns was losing my job as there were HEAVY layoffs - losing your job at the same time many other people are losing theirs AND the market is down so drawing from investments to live on is not a great combination. 

So I still have a large emergency fund - I’m retiring next year and it’ll be my cash bucket - right now it’s actually larger than I need (around 12% of my portfolio) but only because I’m moving and buying a new house next year and some it will go to that. By the end of my first year in retirement I’ll bring it down to 5% of my portfolio which will be a couple years in “essential” expenses (lower than my planned spending - basically the floor of my plan).",1761318062.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1oehnh3/i_have_been_increasing_the_size_of_my_emergency/nl5bfs1/

I was older when I got my head screwed on straight.

I suggest making sure you and your lady are aligned in financial style. People have different core beliefs about finances. You probably won't get perfect alignment. Bad alignment/agreement about finances can lead to very bad outcomes. Complete agreement about children is also very important. Divorce, especially with children, can destroy your financial plan and wellbeing. BTDT, lived in a state of constant strife. After divorce I wasn't able to get back to solid finances until I was mid-40s.

A general recommendation for investing for a comfortable retirement with a lifestyle comparable to your working years with retirement at \~65 is to invest 20%-25% of your gross income. Your planned $5280 a month would be correct for a $154,800 gross annual income.

Broad,Bogleheads,1oe45kz,Anyone planning to leave VT in their Roth IRA for life (no bonds)?,nkyudzy,"From my perspective it helps to break your question down into two sub questions. The first is about asset allocation to equities v/s fixed income across ALL accounts in which you are saving for retirement. And the second question is which asset to allocate money in the Roth IRA v/s other accounts such as traditional 401k/IRA, and any taxable accounts. 

Conventional wisdom is to have some allocation to fixed income in your total portfolio to reduce volatility, although the exact percentage depends on many factors such as age, risk taking ability etc. 

Having said the above, it does make sense to have your Roth account be 100% equity because you will likely have the best returns with that asset class and they will be tax free in a Roth. This is of course assuming you have fixed income exposure elsewhere, ideally in a tax deferred account such as a traditional 401k/IRA.",1761231479.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1oe45kz/anyone_planning_to_leave_vt_in_their_roth_ira_for/nkyudzy/

Choose an amount you know you don’t need. If you don’t have a separate emergency fund, set that up first with 3 months basic expenses in a high interest savings account. That way you know you have access to money if you really need it and can feel more comfortable about your investing money regularly going out. EXPECT a crash. It’s normal.

Hey Bogleheads,

I’m 30 and just starting my long-term investing journey. My goal is a simple, mostly hands-off portfolio.

- Taxable (Fidelity): 100% VTI — where any extra money goes after maxing tax-advantaged accounts.

- Roth IRAs (mine + spouse) Planning on max both mine and my wife’s: 80% VUG / 20% VGT, possibly adding 3–5% BTC. Aware it’s tech-heavy but comfortable with the volatility for long-term growth.

- SEP IRA: Planning $20–60k per year. Debating between keeping it simple with VT or doing 70/30 VTI + VXUS for more control.

- Emergency fund: 6 months in SPAXX at Fidelity; plan to redirect overflow to BND. Will probably add more here as when I get older. 

Looking for feedback on whether VT makes sense for the SEP IRA or if splitting VTI/VXUS is better. Also open to any tax-efficiency tips.

>Roth IRAs (mine + spouse) Planning on max both mine and my wife’s: 80% VUG / 20% VGT, possibly adding 3–5% BTC. Aware it’s tech-heavy but comfortable with the volatility for long-term growth.

This doesn't align with the [Bogleheads Investing Philosophy](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy). A significant tilt towards US large cap growth (while excluding large cap value, mid cap, small cap, and international) makes no sense. Consider something like the three fund portfolio. See the sidebar: [Building Your 'Lazy Portfolio'](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/How_to_build_a_lazy_portfolio).

>SEP IRA: Planning $20–60k per year. Debating between keeping it simple with VT or doing 70/30 VTI + VXUS for more control

Yes this is good.

>Emergency fund: 6 months in SPAXX at Fidelity; plan to redirect overflow to BND. Will probably add more here as when I get older.

This is fine too. Personally I wouldn't overflow anything to BND, instead I would max tax advantaged accounts and invest the rest in stock index funds in a brokerage account.

>Looking for feedback on whether VT makes sense for the SEP IRA or if splitting VTI/VXUS is better. 

I would personally recommend VT, it encourages less tinkering.

Broad,Bogleheads,1ocyjop,How Accurate Is This?,nkq4zdo,"Sounds like you've got the gist of it.

Not all, but many, Bogleheads would encourage you to add exposure to international stocks, too. The analogues are: FZILX and VXUS.

Note that FXAIX, FNILX, FZILX, and FZROX are mutual funds (""MFs""), whereas VOO, VTI, and VXUS are exchange-traded funds (""ETFs""). In my opinion, the difference between MFs and ETFs is overhyped, but if you're investing in a taxable brokerage account (as opposed to a tax-protected retirement account such as an IRA), then the consensus recommendation is generally to use ETFs rather than MFs.

Also, note that any of the Fidelity ""zero"" funds (FNILX, FZROX, and FZILX) are MFs at Fidelity. That just means that you can't buy them at any other brokerage. Again, in my opinion, this nuance is probably overhyped, but the consensus recommendation is generally to only use proprietary funds like these in tax-protected accounts. The logic is, if you ever decided you wanted to move your assets to a different brokerage, such as Vanguard, then it would be easy to do so if your Fidelity proprietary MFs are in a tax-protected account, because you can simply sell them there without incurring taxes, and then transfer the cash from your Fidelity IRA to your Vanguard IRA. However, if you own the proprietary MFs inside of a taxable Fidelity account, you would have to sell and realize a taxable gain before you could move your assets to a taxable Vanguard account.

TL;DR: Mutual funds, including the Fidelity proprietary ""Zero"" mutual funds, are great inside of a tax-protected account like an IRA, but most people would recommend exchange-traded funds like VOO, VTI, and VXUS if you need to buy funds inside a taxable brokerage account.

I *personally* like international diversification, and given that I’m not a fan of market timing/picking, I just use global market cap weights. The same reasons one would use a total US fund like you do would lead one to use a global index. So, in my Roth, if I was on Vanguard’s platform, I’d likely be 100% VTWAX, which is the mutual fund version of VT. (I like mutual funds more than ETFs in my IRA). 

If you aren’t convinced of international diversification, stay the course. Don’t touch anything. 

If you’re convinced of international diversification but don’t want to go full market cap weighting, you could choose a fixed international allocation of anywhere between 10-40% of your equity and use a fund like VTIAX and rebalance ~yearly. IMO there’s no logical reason to not do 10-20% international at the minimum as a hedge, but that’s a position you’ll have to weigh yourself. 

If you want to know why I’m *personally* pro-international diversification, see the links below and you can make your own informed decision yourself either way.

(1) This video, while a bit odd in its presentation, shows how going for global market cap weights is safer than 100% domestic US or 100% international. If the US continues to outperform, you’ll still get very rich if that continues. If it doesn’t continue, you’ll still get rich. It’s win-win. Main risk is if everything does poorly, but in that case, we are all screwed anyway. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFzAI21TiJc&t=937s

2. If your stock pays dividends you are taxed on them, even if you reinvest them.
3. If your account pays interest you are taxed on that.

In terms of tax rates:

1. Stocks held longer than 1 year are taxed as ""long-term"" (lower rate), less than 1 year as ""short-term"" (same rate as ordinary income)
2. Dividends are taxed either as qualified (same as long-term capital gains) or non-qualified (same as ordinary) depending on the classification of the stock

Broad,Bogleheads,1ocecy6,How do taxes work in a brokerage account?,nkmafg0,"A taxable account is the baseline where there are no exceptions to taxes. Moving money out of the account is not a taxable event, you're taxed when gains are *realized*. That can be selling or receiving a dividend or, less commonly, a capital gains distribution from a fund. The only one of those you have control over is selling.

Tax rate is determined in 1 of 2 ways, the money is taxed according to the income tax brackets of the long term capital gains brackets. Short term gains from selling are taxed as income and long term gains from selling are taxed as ltcg. Ordinary dividends are taxed as income and qualified dividends are taxed as ltcg. It's not universal, but most dividends will be taxed as income and as long as you aren't trading most gains from selling will be ltcg. All else being equal, if you could choose how some gains are taxed, your ltcg rate will be lower.

Since gains are realized in a taxable event it doesn't matter what you *do* with the money afterwards so even if you don't *have* the money you're still on the hook for the taxes. Ex. You sell an asset that's up 10k and then reinvest all the proceeds from the sale in something else. You don't have cash from that sale, but you're going to have to pay taxes on that 10k of realized gains.

Tax advantaged accounts ignore capital gains completely but there are many other caveats. The only time you're taxed on withdrawal is with a traditional tax advantaged account, but that's not capital gains tax, that's paying the income tax that you avoided paying when you made the contribution to that type of account.",1761062360.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1ocecy6/how_do_taxes_work_in_a_brokerage_account/nkmafg0/

I don't understand why people care about this so much. Income tax in the US is progressive, it's only the portion about the cutoff that gets taxed at the higher rate so if you go over by a bit, it really doesn't matter much at all. This idea of being ""kicked into a higher tax bracket"" is misleading terminology. 

Most will be splitting hairs about how much gets taxed in the 22% bracket vs. a bit spilling into the 24% bracket under current tax structure if we're keeping it real. I'd argue that's hardly worth locking up too much till you're 59 depending on your situation. Could taxes go up? Sure. They could also not. Plenty of us top off in a higher tax bracket now than we will in retirement. Now if you're trying to keep your MAGI low for other reasons, then it starts to become more valuable.",1760910179.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1oaxxe9/if_i_make_enough_money_investing_in_voo_through_a/nkdoqza/

The taxable amount is the amount of gains (current value - original purchase amount).

The tax rate is first wherever those dollars land in the capital gains tax brackets -- short term holdings use the same tax brackets as ordinary income, long term holdings get the more favorable long term capital gains rates.

If all your gains are long term, and ""all your ordinary income"" + ""all your realized gains"" < $48k, then you'll realize those gains at 0%.

The example with numbers I was trying to lay out how the gains themselves get exposed to progressive brackets. How about I try again.

If you have $40k of income, and you sold $150k of long term investments that you originally purchased for $50k (realizing $150k - $50k = $100k of gains). That's $140k of income, the ""first"" $40k is ordinary income, the ""next"" $100k is Long Term Capital Gains.

Here's how the taxes work (I'm rounding some brackets):  
$40k income:  
dollar 0 to 16k ($16k) at 0% (standard deduction)  
dollar 16k to 28k ($12k) at 10%  
dollar 28k to 40k ($22k) at 12%

Then $100k of long term capital gains stacks on top:  
dollar 40k to 48k ($8k) at 0% LTCG  
dollar 48k to 140k ($92k) at 15% LTCG",1760905059.0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1oaxxe9/if_i_make_enough_money_investing_in_voo_through_a/nkd7tyf/

So if you realize $48,350 in capital gains and $0 income you do fit into the 0% tax bracket. Thanks to the standard deduction you will even be able to earn regular income up to $15,000 and still be in the 0% capital gains tax bracket. 

But let’s say your take home pay is $63,351.

For context, I’m an old guy that spent the last 30 years thinking I can beat the market. Here’s what you can learn from that. If I would’ve just put everything in VT or something similar (VTI/VXUS) and just kept contributing without making any changes, I’d have many millions!! (I didn’t do that, so I don’t have many millions lol) 

Time goes really fast so don’t worry about the short term. You are 24 and time is on your side so try not to worry about what’s going to happen tomorrow, a month from now, this year or next or the one after that. Block out the noise! Just set it and forget it. Don’t keep $ on the sidelines because you think something’s going to happen. No one knows what will happen. Just keep contributing and don’t be swayed by anything else. 30 years from now remember my post and say thank you!

You already know what to invest in so the only additional advice I have for you is read everything in these links and embrace the philosophy. The strategy you can figure out for your self although the simpler the better (VT is as simple as it gets) but the philosophy is the key!
After you read those links over and over use them as a reference and also read the BH guide to investing and The simple path to wealth. Checkout the Tao of Warren Buffet and embrace Buffet or Munger quotes. 

Be really careful listening to strangers on the internet. This sub for the most part will give you good consistent advice but remember the philosophy doesn’t change, but the strategies can be different based on the person. There’s no right or wrong way if you’re following the philosophy and you don’t have to be super rigid. Anyone that tells you they know what’s going to happen tomorrow is full of it! 

For additional context, I’m 56 now and spent my whole life in the same HCOL area as you and I know what it’s like to be a NYer! 

You have a great opportunity being young and informed. Don’t F it up!

A great Jack Bogle quote is 
“Don’t do something just stand there!” 

You got this. Good Luck!

1. The fund will realize capital gains that you pay taxes on, even if you're not selling anything.
2. You get a more favorable tax treatment by keeping bonds in a tax advantaged account.

You can keep VT in taxable and TDF in 401k/IRA to improve on that situation, but your tradeoff is that you'll either accept that your allocation for equities/bonds will be skewed towards equities OR you'll have to add extra bonds in your 401k/IRA to offset the lack of bonds in taxable.

Alternatively, you can decide at any time to give up on the TDF in your 401k/IRA and switch to individual funds. The tradeoff in that case is just the loss of simplicity and automation.

VT is fine.  VTI is fine.  They are both aggressive enough.  Look at an efficient frontier curve sometime.  The difference between 60/40 and 70/30 really isn't that great.

No need to tilt towards tech, or [any sector](https://novelinvestor.com/sector-performance/), because sectors outperform in unpredictable ways and the market already has priced in all the available information about future expected performance. Tilting in that way tends to just introduce [uncompensated risk](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/), which means that you're taking on more risk than investing in a total market index fund, but you can't expect to receive better returns than the market average.

You don't need any concentration in ""the 100 largest (non-financial) companies that happen to trade on the nasdaq exchange"". It's a nonsense index. There's no fundamental reason for that selection criteria to outperform in the future, it only looks attractive because of the last decade of performance.

The BH philosophy is aligned with using index funds to own the whole market, not trying to predict or time the market, focusing on decades and not days, not trying to predict short term moves, investing early and often to be rewarded by compound interest. Staying the course! Keeping things simple.

Contrast those philosophies with the specifics of your post. Sounds like fear and if you’re all in on tech and not diversified you probably should be a bit worried if tech doesn’t continue to surge.

Broad,Bogleheads,1o6v4uw,Is anyone worried about an economic crash?,njk0qal,"I'm not worried. If you are following Boglehead principles, the play is not to guess the next move. The move is just holding a broad market index at a risk level you can live with and keep buying.

History’s worst crashes punished two groups: people on margin and people who bailed. Savers who kept purchasing shares recovered, and retirees who held a stock and bond mix and rebalanced got through it.

For example, consider the crash that kicked off the Great Depression. In 1929, the only investors who wore the full near-90% peak-to-trough loss were those who happened to buy their entire portfolio at the exact top. Most people did not. Many who began investing in 1926–1927 saw their gains erased in the crash; by the mid-1930s they were back in positive territory simply by holding and continuing to add new money. Others who had bought at the earlier 1920 peak took an immediate hit, recovered in about five years, then after 1929 were back to even by 1936 by staying invested. Workers who kept their jobs through the Depression had years of bargain prices, so every contribution bought more shares and raised future returns. The permanent wipeouts came from leverage. Margin calls forced sales at the bottom; unlevered investors endured a brutal stretch but stayed in the game and participated in the recovery.

VOOG is a growth tilt, so expect bigger swings. If that volatility bothers you, that is a concentration problem, not a timing signal. Shift toward a total-market fund and a stock and bond mix you can hold before the weather turns, then ignore forecasts and stick to the plan.

Remember that crashes are both inevitable and rare. The long-term climb has dominated for more than a century. Stick to simple Boglehead philosophy, automate contributions, rebalance on schedule, avoid margin and you will be okay even if the big one happens again.",1760494760.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1o6v4uw/is_anyone_worried_about_an_economic_crash/njk0qal/

Are you currently living off your portfolio and therefore have a large percentage in bonds? If not, don't worry about gold (too much).

Gold is a bond/currency hedge. Central banks buy it to hedge their bonds/currency. They can trade with it in the event they can't use bonds/currency. The current run-up is from central bank buying. 

Gold in a portfolio works the same way: hedging bonds and fiat. This matters if you hold a lot of bonds + cash for shorter-term needs.

The longer the period over which you DCA, the greater the odds that lump sum at the beginning of that period would come out ahead.  After you have finished the DCA, you're fully invested and subject to the same risks either way.

When people typically talk about DCA odds, they're more frequently talking about periods of more than a year.  The link in the sidebar talks about an analysis of 24 months. Sometimes DCA wins over lump sum, more often it loses.  You could even do half and half.

Broad,Bogleheads,1o5a013,VT and chill with DCA or lump sum?,nj9tad8,"Your question comes up 100s of times in this group so it’s obviously one that many people think about. 

However, you’re asking this in a BH sub and you know it’s not part of BH philosophy and you’re already invested in VT. You can pretty much predict what the consensus response is going to be to your post. 

Here’s one way for you to view it. You’re 27, let’s assume you have roughly 40 years of investing time horizon to continue your journey of contributing to VT. If you lump sum everything today or lump summed everything last week before Friday’s dip do you feel strongly that it would really make a difference? 

I’m assuming that you are committed to investing in VT or the like well into retirement so you must believe that over the years the market will continue to grow correct? No one knows for sure but 40 years from now I don’t think your decision to lump sum or DCA would have had a huge impact. The impact will be from 40 years of compounding growth and how much you continue to contribute right? 

Here are a few Buffet quotes that are relevant. 

“If you aren’t willing to hold a stock for 10 years don’t even think about holding it for 10 minutes.”

“The market may go up, the market may go down, but in the long run it will go up”

“The best chance of success comes from owning good businesses and holding them for a long time.”


Hopefully, that gives you a different way to think about it. 

But, if you just can’t bring yourself to jam the full amount into VT then DCA if it helps you sleep better. 

Good luck and btw, amazing job in following BH strategy and prioritizing your retirement strategy by owning VT. You will most likely be  financially solid if you continue on that path for the next 40 or so years.

Probably a smart move due to most of it not being in retirement accounts. A lot of states have rules protecting retirement accounts from being able to drawn upon for a court ruling.

Finally, you really don’t need the full 2 million. We are now starting talk in the ranges of general mid market commercial policies, even in those claims it’s rare that anyone gets policy limits. For you to cause an excess of 2.5 million dollar settlement, would be extremely unlikely.

You are absolutely correct: there is nothing supporting that your limits should be equal to your net worth. I’ve seen this put out there in other places and there’s nothing to support it. 

You should ask two questions: (1) do you have collectible assets? If yes, go on to two: (2) how much in a reasonable worst case would I need to insure myself for such that a plaintiff would settle a case within insurance limits rather than risk any recovery to pursue your additional assets?

Unless you have very substantial collectible seven figure assets, a plaintiff and plaintiff’s lawyer is unlikely to forego a seven figure insurance settlement offer to go after you personally. 

I have litigated brain injury cases with settlement values of > $10m, but I have never had one where I would advise a client to turn down a $2m insurance limit offer in that situation to pursue several hundred thousand dollars in personal assets.  

The reality is $2m will provide you ample protection in almost all circumstances, even in catastrophic injury cases with much higher damages.

Additionally, if an insured liability is clearly at or greater than the insured limit, the carrier has a legal duty to tender their full limit to try to settle the case on behalf of the insured.

At the same time, the strategy has kept people invested in the equity market despite all of the reasons that have come up to sell out.

I don't think the deficit is funded specifically by either short-term or long-term debt.  It's all gov't borrowing, and they have the ability to shift where they issue debt.

It is true that the curve could steepen.  It could also shift down equal amounts if the term premium stays the same but people believe short-rates will be held low for an extended period of time (one way to finance yourself cheaply is to hold short-term rates at/below inflation and issue a bunch of short-term debt).

Anyways, something that is not sustainable will eventually stop.

That's fine. Maybe a little light on emerging markets, the international market is about 75% Developed, 25% Emerging, so getting to something like 30% SCHF, 10% SCHE would be a little closer (but this is a really small thing).

Right!

Truthfully, I don't know or remember why I chose both FSKAX and FZROX... That's one reason why I want to change to 100% VT (or 90% VT and 10% BND/etc.), and because I'm not sure if I should have the exact same funds in two different retirement accounts? I'm going to leave the HSA as is with the zero funds because I'll never transfer my HSA out from Fidelity.

Probably recency bias... but actually not noticing *this year*. Over the last decade US has done better, but that's no prediction of future results. In fact: year to date total international has done better than US.

VOO (S&P500) is somewhat of an approximation of the US market, but it has no expectation of outperforming the mid and small cap companies that appear in the VTI but not VOO.

International and US have [cycles of outperformance](https://www.mymoneyblog.com/us-vs-international-stocks-cycles-outperformance.html) compared to each other, so it's wise to hold international.

In a well diversified portfolio you'll always have *some* part of your portfolio that's underperforming. Performance chasing (jumping from one recent outperformer to the other) always means you missed some of the performance, so broad diversification is the way.

The global market weight is about 60% US, 40% International, and it seems like the range of 20 to 40% in international is the least argued over, still gives you some ability to decide what's right for you -- but going with the global market weight is a *very reasonable* way to go. Using VT gets you the global market weight. Using VTI + VXUS is fine if you want a different ratio.

Yes, absolutely. 90% VT + 10% Bonds would be a perfectly reasonable portfolio for your 30s.

You're right that you're really in hair-splitting territory now 90% VT + 10% BND is a great way to go. Here's a probably longer answer than how important this choice is:

90% VT + 10% BND expense ratio is very close to 55% FZROX + 35% FZILX + 10% FXNAX... something like 0.057% vs 0.0025%, or about $5.45 per $10k invested, per year.

On the other hand VT is marginally more complete: VT has 9990 holdings vs FZROX (2578) + FZILX (2193) = 4771 holdings. Now, those 5000 missing companies are going to be the smallest cap US and international, they're not going to move the needle a lot, but that's another tiny difference.

Next: in a taxable account specifically, the Zero funds aren't portable, which means you may be forced to realize a potentially large taxable capital gain if you *ever* want to move your account. So, in taxable, you'd actually probably prefer 55% FSKAX + 35% FTIHX + 10% FXNAX (combined expense 0.03175%, so now you're saving like $2.52/yr/$10k compared to VT).

Finally: again, only in taxable account: there's a small foreign tax credit (about 0.2% of the number of dollars you hold in the international fund), but you only get that credit if you hold the international in a separate fund (like VTI + VXUS, FSKAX + FTIHX, but *not* like VT).

So where does that leave you?

Broad,Bogleheads,1o47r3t,Why does this subreddit think worldwide index funds are efficiently weighted?,nj2brwv,"I don't understand it either 

Bogle himself was against international for a bunch of reasons. Primarily because American companies already do a lot of business globally and so an investment in the S&P 500 is anyway an investment in the global economy 

The notion that the global cap weights are something everyone should follow seems a little bit nuts to me, and seems to fail to understand why Bogle liked cap weights 

Bogle didn't think cap weight was some perfect allocation. He just thought it was cheap and tax efficient and well diversified. An inexpensive way for the average person to get very good diversification in a fund that would keep their taxes low.

International DOESN'T keep you taxes low, it has all kinds of tax problems both inside and outside retirement accounts. You get LESS of the return for your dollar and that should be an argument to at least reduce the weight. 

Secondly a lot of foreign markets aren't as transparent or fair as the US market. This is especially true of emerging markets. There's a lot more insider trading, self dealing, and outright fraud happening that can deprive foreign investors of their fair share of the return. 

Look at the explosive GDP growth in places like China and the number of millionaires and billionaires that growth created - then look at how China ETFs have mostly just gone sideways with little to none of that growth being shared with public stock market investors. The growth was there, but it was siphoned off by insiders in ways that just doesn't happen as often in the United States 

So you're right. There's an argument that the average person should avoid international and focus on VOO/VTI, or have only a smaller investment in intentional, below its cap weight, in recognition that you don't get as much for your investment dollar within international.",1760250652.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1o47r3t/why_does_this_subreddit_think_worldwide_index/nj2brwv/

Broad,Bogleheads,1o2x1i1,Going 100%,nisxiqr,"You sure you understand how the match works? 10% is unbelievably high if it's a 1:1 match. 

Most places talk about a match meaning they'll match $1 for every $1 you contribute up to some percentage of salary and that's what people are talking about when they say to contribute up to the match because otherwise you're opting out of part of your compensation. That's typical more like 5%

Another way it can be structured is the employer matches a percentage of your contribution which is much more likely if it's 10%, so for every $10 you contribute they contribute $1. There's no limit on that type of match other than the 401k contribution limits, but you have to max your contributions in order to maximize the match.

My own IRA's (mostly rolled over from 401Ks when I retired young) are in individual high dividend stocks including REIT's.

There’s some overlap with VOO and VGT. Depending on who you ask some people will say VOO or VTI (or their equivalents). 

VGT has a 0.1% ER vs VOO with 0.03%. Not portfolio breaking at this point but getting the the Millions in your account this can be up to $700 per million. Not the end of the world. 

VTI will give you a much broader coverage over VOO as it also covers the mid and small stocks that VOO does not. (More broad, therefore theoretically more diversified) 

Some will aim for a much easier VT which is a typical 60/40 US/ex-US fund. But as you get other accounts (taxable, 401k, 457, etc) it may make more sense to split them yourself to VTI and VXUS to allocate them across multiple accounts for better tax purposes. 

The level of US vs Ex-US depends on your risk tolerance. Conventional boglehead teachers appear to have a safe 60/40 split for this. 

Some people increase the US/ex-us ration to up to 80/20. VTI and VXUS allows you to do that whereas VT wouldn’t. 

As you get older (mid to late 30s) you’d start adding bonds to your account. 

I stick with a standard VTI (or equivalent total stock, or S&P500 fund if my 401k doesn’t have a good total stock market fund), VXUS (or equivalent) and BND for my bonds. 

I prefer simplicity in my life and don’t like to worry about the daily ups and downs as the swings are HUGE now. Stocks 90% Bonds 10%. Us/ex-US stocks 80/20.

Unless you have really compelling reasons to do otherwise, global market cap weighting should probably be your default allocation. (Note: ""Compelling reasons"" do not include ""tech is the hot sector right now"" or ""I'm all in on growth stocks"" or ""Dividends are so important to long-term wealth accumulation."")

Relative to a global market cap weighted portfolio, you are extremely light on exposure to small cap U.S. stocks (maybe zero exposure), and you are underweight on exposure to international stocks, which by latest estimates are closer to 35% rather than 20%. Correspondingly, you are significantly overweight on exposure to a handful of mega cap U.S. stocks. You may think you're diversified, when in fact, you're not as much as you think you are. NVDA alone is 17% of VGT and also 8% of VOO. MSFT is 14% and 7%, respectively. Whereas, if you bought a simple, global market cap weighted fund like VT, NVDA and MSFT would each only be about 4%.

Broad,Bogleheads,1o2iwsp,Roth/Taxable investments advice,nioa3fy,"Not the worst thing I have seen, but if it were me I would tweak a little.  Most glaringly SCHD is going to give you poor performance over the long term.  Dividends are taxed at your regular income amount (which may be relatively low since you are young)  but will likely underperform the rest of your account in the long run.  Whether a company gives you the money as a dividend, buyback, or just keeps it for you raising the value of the stock you own, is immaterial except that the last option is the most tax efficient for you.  Is there a specific reason you felt that having dividends was important?  

The schg is unnecessary as it is covered by VOO, and schg is more expensive.  The VGT is even more expensive.  They may outperform VOO in the short run, but are just as likely to lag if the Ai bubble pops.  If you believe that you will outsmart the market with this strategy, that is fine, it will only be a relatively small drag overall.   

The BND is ok but I would consider putting it in the Roth, especially as you get into the higher tax brackets.  The interest you get is counted as ordinary income and taxed at a higher rate if you are in a high tax bracket.   

The bigger picture is that these are just nitpicks and likely wont change the overall trajectory of your investment portfolio, but they don't quite accord with best practices.    

From the 30k view the important part is to keep saving, and investing in low cost etfs, and let time do the work.  the worst thing you can be is inpatient.",1760048524.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1o2iwsp/rothtaxable_investments_advice/nioa3fy/

Broad,Bogleheads,1o1v93b,Inefficient Allocations?,nil2or2,"> $12,500 in VTSAX $6000 in VSVNX $5000 in VOO

The issue here is overlap. The goal of the three-fund portfolio is not to have a count of three investments, it's the three asset classes: Total US, Total International, and Bonds.

VSVNX is the Vanguard Target Retirement 2070 Fund. Target date funds are self-contained, automatically rebalancing, globally diversified portfolios of stocks and bonds, where the bond allocation increases as you age. That particular TDF is a very low expense ratio for what it provides. That could reasonably be your only investment in your Roth IRA.

VTSAX is total US, which you already own via the target date fund, and VOO is S&P500, which you already own with both the other funds (it's contained inside total US, and therefore also contained in the target date fund).

Target date funds work best all-or-nothing, because they contain everything else, so ""adding"" S&P500 just tilts you towards US Large Caps (which you already own, at market weight), which reduces your diversification.

> How do I ensure more diversification and fix my current allocations so that I can more efficiently set up my investments?

Luckily you can exchange funds inside a Roth IRA without tax consequences, so this is easily fixed once you've settled on a strategy.

All those choices you list (or just going with the TDF alone) are *reasonable* choices. Folks in their twenties often start without bonds, but a 10% bond allocation is good too, and what you get with the TDF. The TDF gives you the easiest set-it and forget-it option. If you have to start balancing multiple accounts that don't all have a good TDF option available, *or* if you want to manage the allocation yourself, then going with some ratio of VTSAX, VTIAX, VBTLX is a great choice too.

>  I also know another option is to stop buying what I currently have and only invest in what I want from this point on too.

My advice, don't get too fancy with your allocations. keep it as simple as possible. this helps prevent decision paralysis and making moves, usually the wrong ones, at the worst time.  This is just human psychology.  If you own 1 fund your only decision is how much to contribute.  

How much you save, not the perfect asset allocation, will have a greater impact on your long term success.  Avoid FOMO. Don't compare. Model what you might need to meet your goals, not someone else's goals.

That's fine, but it does imply that you will have to revisit your portfolio in your 30s, 40s, or 50s to make decisions about when, and by how much, you want to start adding bonds.

AOA isn't *wrong* for a young investor with a long time horizon. It's probably just a little more conservative than average. It would also probably be a fine choice if you literally never want to adjust your allocation from 80% stocks, 20% bonds, forever. Some might tell you that 80:20 is too aggressive in retirement, but again, it's just above average, not inherently wrong.

You didn't mention if this investment is for a brokerage account or a retirement account like a IRA/401k. If it's for a retirement account, then my recommendation would be to strongly, strongly consider a target date index mutual fund. It only has 5-10% bonds when you're young, but it gradually adds more bonds for you over time. It's honestly the best of both worlds between VT and AOA. 

Note 1: Make sure it's a Target Date *Index* Fund, and make sure its expense ratio is 0.2% or less.

Note 2: Target date funds are great in retirement accounts. They're fine-ish in taxable brokerage accounts, but everyone on the subreddit will be quick to point out that they can distribute capital gains in a taxable account, which may increase your tax payments over time.

Sure, I get that it's the go to recommendation for a bond fund, even on this sub.

But neither of those apply here.  The asset allocation is known, so we can determine an optimal duration for the bond holdings.

I would not recommend it.  I certainly wouldn't recommend doing it 100%, since your domestic/international allocation should not be determined by whatever size the accounts happen to be.  You could do it where the smaller overflows into the other account so you maintain 60/40, and there would be slight tax benefits, but I wouldn't recommend it.

Bogle’s - pensions are good enough bond assets; figure out the pension capitalized value and treat as bonds.  Adjust investment portfolio as needed

Pensions as income reducers - if your expected needs in retirement are 40k and your pension will pay 20k; your needed draw is 20k

How long have you been doing it? It's possible that you were caught up in the 2021 snafu where many of your positions realized their gains. This might mean you have fewer gains now than you think. 

There seems to be two pieces of competing logic when it comes to this:

1. I have a lot of unrealized gains, so I'll wait as long as possible realize them to avoid a tax hit now or in my earning years, while my taxes are high due to my income.

2. I have a lot of unrealized gains, but I'll realize them now because they're likely to grow over time, exacerbating the problem, and I can afford to realize them now because I make a lot of money.

It can be a little bit tricky to sell out of a TDF fund and minimize the tax implications.. I did it with Vanguard and they have some tools to make easier.

VTI is investing in more smaller and medium sized companies, and has like 3200 different holding compared to VOO’s 500. 

VOO vs VTI depends on if you want to hope that small companies make great strides (go with VTI), want to reduce the risk of a major company fails (again, VTI) or want to bet on companies which are proven successful while smaller and medium companies would be more likely to fail (VOO). 

Honestly in my also newer to investing opinion, the difference between those two is more personal choice than anything. 

VXUS is a completely different beast - all of its holding are international. So that’s a fund you would take if you were worried about, or wanting to hedge against the possibility of, the US market falling or the international markets outperforming the US. 

Target date funds handle much of this risk assessment for you, but automatically rebalancing your holdings in not just US markets but also international and extremely safe (but poor returns) investments like treasury bonds. The problem, as I am learning, is that when they rebalance then it’s technically selling some riskier investments in order to buy safer ones, which means that you’re realizing the gains when they do it, and will owe taxes on it. If you make under 90k then it’s really not an issue at all (0% tax rate for long term capital gains), but I’m probably in the highest tax bracket I’ll ever be in so I’m paying 15% on the gains when they rebalance. It’s not life altering but it would be preferable to wait until I retire and actually intentionally sell and make withdrawals so that I won’t have to pay that 15%; however if I cash out of the target date right now then I’m going to be paying the 15% anyway so might as well leave it parked since it’s been there so long, as I’d literally be forcing the thing I’m trying to avoid (paying taxes on that money before I use it)",1759797260.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1nzn0xc/i_have_a_significant_amount_of_money_invested_in/ni5z2wh/

Any who Roth sounds good based on your income.  You need to open up an account at fidelity or vanguard. 

Normally you would open up both a brokerage and a Roth IRA.  You can use the brokerage as a HYSA, and to fund the Roth.

Since we dont know which house you are going with, i cant really comment on what mutual fund to use for the roth.  Typically you do ETF's in the brokerage and mutual funds in Roth, just for tax efficiency.

* Sell any lots at losses now and use those losses to offset gains from the lots where you've made money
* Sell any lots that are breakeven
* Don't sell any gains from lots you've held for less than 366 days or you'll have to pay ordinary earned income tax rates, which are much higher than long-term capital gains tax rates
* Start investing new money into VXUS until you achieve your desired allocations (65% US and 35% ex-US is the actual market weight) 
* You can also add VXF to capture the rest of the US market not in the S&P 500; market allocation is about 52% VOO (S&P 500, same as your VFIAX), 13% VXF, and 35% VXUS 
* If you happen to have very low income and still have room in the 0% LTCG tax bracket, you can sell some more of your US position at a gain and not pay tax on it; this will tax harvest (advantageous) and accelerate your rebalance to your US/ex-US allocation target

I was basically asking where people make mistakes with entering data in the retirement planners (not changing default settings, having inflation rate too low etc, or forgetting to account for ?????)

I wasn’t really trying  to get a check on my math, as I was intentionally vague with my numbers. I probably should just post up the numbers as suggested by another user.
I do have a pension that’s about $50k/yr. I did mention it(the fact I have a pension, but not the value), but it was lost in the ramble.

Your reply seems to imply that there is no return on my investments? And that I pull $200k immediately? The HELOC has a bit high interest rate at 7% , and paying it off is a priority, but I didn’t plan to immediately drain $200k. Of course you weren’t aware of the pension.


Even with the pension, social security and my retirement accounts I’m not sure I’m comfortable…. Which is just stupid….. I waste too much money m!",1759825318.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1nxspvv/request_for_help_on_potential_errors_on_diy/ni7omuf/

My comment about the reduction in your net worth was just based on the sum of the loan & the 5-6% you mentioned you would withdraw annually for each of the three years before you receive Social Security (SS).

You ask if I ignore your ""return on investments"", but you have an immediate need for cash to pay living expenses. It is imprudent to assume your nest egg will apprecIate enough to cover expenses over the next three years; we could just as easily have a 10% correction in that time period. 

You may have a nice real (inflation adjusted) return in the long term but your net worth three years out  assuming no knowledge about investment returns is $1M - $33K loan payoff - ( 3 yrs * about $55K living expenses per yr) i.e. about $800K when you start collecting SS.",1759974717.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1nxspvv/request_for_help_on_potential_errors_on_diy/nij06tl/

Broad,Bogleheads,1nxj4xs,29 $0 invested,nhpgfrn,"A Roth is a type of tax protected account, not an asset class like stocks or bonds.  You can hold stocks and bonds in a Roth 401k or Roth IRA.  Probably want to hold high growth rate investments in the Roth since there will be no tax on the withdrawals later.  However, bonds provide income every year in a taxable account, so you want to be aware of the tax impact of that.

The limits for contributing to tax protected accounts are annual, so once you have passed the deadline for contributing in a given year, you have lost the opportunity to contribute that amount… I guess what I am saying with this add on statement is that your future self will appreciate your current self if you put as much as possible into tax protected accounts - especially early in your career when it is difficult, but provides the most compounding benefit.

Broad,Bogleheads,1nxj4xs,29 $0 invested,nhrikpu,"This is not financial advice, but you should open a Roth IRA and put your money in there. Basically it is an individual account you can open yourself whereas virtually all 401ks are employer sponsored. 

Generally the most efficient investing plan is to invest up to the 401k match (which is not applicable to you), then max out your Roth IRA and HSA (if you’re on a high deductible health plan that qualifies for HSA), then finish maxing out your 401k. There is no need for you to concern yourself with a Roth 401k given $300/month would not max out your Roth IRA (which is okay! Better something than nothing).

So, basically: take your $300 and put it into a Roth IRA. It looks like between stocks and bonds you are looking at 2/3 stocks and 1/3 bonds, but given your age I would recommend not holding more than 10% bonds at this point - you won’t be touching this money for 30+ years so stocks will grow that money more efficiently.

The most boglehead approach to the portfolio would be broad based index funds and not owning any individual stocks. You can buy VTI or VOO in a Roth IRA, but (again not financial advice) I would look into buying VT, or VTI + VXUS, to get some international exposure. This reduces concentration risk in just American large cap stocks (and if you do want VOO, don’t pair it with VTI, since ~70% of VTI is in VOO).

Frankly I think 100% VT is probably perfectly fine until you’re 45 and then you can think about allocating toward bonds too. Makes it nice and simple for you to invest.

Broad,Bogleheads,1nwwjm7,Roth IRA question,nhj3x9g,"Yes, you want to focus on growth. 

A Roth is a tax-advantaged account, so mutual funds are appropriate; I personally would put it all into an index target date fund like VFFVX (2055 target) and never look at it again.

If you’re set on ETFs iShares has a new target date ETF product. ITDG is the iShares 2055 target fund. 

If you’re set on maintaining your own split, you can look at the asset mixes of those target date funds for guidance on your glide path. You probably want a 90/10 split right now, stocks/bonds. Stocks you also probably want to explore splitting between domestic and foreign. VT instead of VOO would take care of the domestic-foreign split (60/40 right now) again unless you want to manage your own split, then VTI and VXUS in the ratio you prefer. Combine with BND and you’ve got your bond market coverage. (SCHD is probably fine too, I have a personal preference for Vanguard funds.)

There are behavioral and succession aspects to also consider, such as:

1. What if you something happens to you? Can your partner and/or kids, assuming they exist, properly handle your portfolio? Do they even want to have that responsibility?


2. Do you need someone to bounce ideas off throughout the year, especially when markets are not going up all the time, they have over the last few years? This entails someone having someone that will also keep you disciplined and aligned with your plan (this assumes you have financial plan). Someone who can also talk you out of bad but often tempting ideas, which tend to creep you when markets are down or more generally when greed kicks in for any number of reasons. 


3. What about time spent on portfolio checking, record keeping and the like? Yes, Boglehead portfolios are simple. We all like them. It’s a feature not a bug. But..are you  the type to stay still and steady. Or are you more likely to sit still and steady when you have someone looking over your shoulder.

decumulation is similar to accumulation; assets naturally drift so you can sell off to rebalance.  if equities are doing great and your 60/40 is now 70/30 its a clear choice to sell only equities until you reach alignment again.

it is also logical to set a rule ""i need 10,000/month; 7000 will come from equities and 3000 from bonds.  Ill rebalance every year""",1759426861.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1nwad3q/concerned_about_choice_of_investments_that_are/nhegi5x/

That is, you'd rebalance to your chosen percentage by selling what is high and buying what is low and then sell the balanced proportions - or shortcut to sell what is high to cash out and rebalance in one shot.

But, when you are paying an advisor they are supposed to have their own well-considered reasons for their picks and when they change them.  Otherwise you shouldn't be paying them for advice.

Personally, I think the boglehead approach of extremely diverse funds (VT or VTI/VXUS) is better than most advisors are going to pick over long time periods.

If your spouse is still working, the CURRENT issue for you is to figure out how much you need from your investments to cover the shortfall between your expenses and his income. If that is zero, than right now you don't really have an issue.

And no, you don't have to own bonds. In fact, anyone who has held bonds over the last 15 years or so has lost value relative to inflation.

Here is my suggestion. Google Javier Estrada 90 10 and read his research on a 90% equity 10% cash equivalent portfolio. Seems to me you are pretty much in that ballpark already, so there is nothing that says you automatically have to change your allocation. It is fine to be heavily allocated to equities in retirement; I have done exactly that for the last 13 years. It depends on your and your spouse's financial situation.

Figure out your long term strategy first--what are your sources of income in retirement, your expenses, and therefore your investment needs--and then tailor your investments to fit that strategy. You have time to do so.",1759444247.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1nw61mc/involuntary_retirement_need_to_rebalance_accounts/nhg2n05/

If you can live off one income you really just have to focus on investing your assets for the long term and estate planning considerations. If you need some income from your retirement investments it seems that a combination of interest, dividends, and capital gains should be able to replace your income while you wait to draw social security and/or other pension income. 

Why is your Roth in cash? The Roth earnings are tax-free and you should be using that for the highest return investments. I don’t have a Roth, but if I did I would load it with Vanguard’s S&P 500 mutual fund (so dividends and capital gains are reinvested) and let it set until I was 80+ and may need some level of senior care. You should see it double 3 times in the next 25 years which should mostly meet your long term care needs (along with social security and Medicare, if you quality).

Simplify your IRA, you don’t need that many funds (and the ones you have are mostly duplicates of each other).

My wife makes $130k

I have put in all constant expenses on a sheet, e.g. Cell Phone, Home Internet, car insurance, mortgage, HOA, medical/eye/dental, costco/sams memberships, etc. etc., and after all the expenses we have about $1200 left for grocery expenses.

It is enough at the moment, and hoping she will get a decent raise next year and a bonus, and I continue to look for jobs.

I'm not sure if I knew the Rule of 55 but I will read about it, thank you for pointing it out.

I looked at the quarter expenses and fees (in Apr to Jun 2025 statement) for both 401K accounts:

    Fidelity: $17.51 
    T. Rowe :  $7.50

    # how the fees look off based on the expense ration given (rhetorical, I'm sure deep diving will reveal the answer)
    Fidelity : $220K (lifepath IDX 2040, expense ratio is 0.0474%)
    T. Rowe: $350K (target 2040, expense ratio is 0.26% i think)

The smaller 401K that I converted to IRA in Schwab is split 60/20/20 among SWTSX/SWISX/SWAGX, overall value since July as increased by 5.6%

I've been perusing Bogleheads for about 1+ year now, and as experiment I invested in the funds listed in my post to see how they perform, as seeing that they have increased in value by double digits percentage points, I figured it would be a good time to look the returns of 401k so far. 

Just to show the gains since June 2024:

    QQQM: +26%
    VOO:  +22%
    VT:   +30%
    VTI:  +29%

If I had converted my T.Rowe 401K to an IRA and invested in any of these ETFs, I would be in a even better position.

Plus since I got laidoff in Apr 2025, I've been searching and trying to understand the nuances of all these retirement plans.

Finally I had some level of understanding to be able to figure out a plan and wanted to check with fellow bogleheads and see if my plan makes sense.

Broad,Bogleheads,1nv9y5l,Opening a Roth,nh736om,"(1) Doesn't really matter re: Fidelity vs. Vanguard. I'd guess most people on this subreddit would say that Fidelity's platform is a little easier to use and their customer service is higher-regarded, but YMMV.

(2) The 3-fund portfolio is the classic starting point for r/Bogleheads. It refers to 3 asset classes, not 3 funds. The 3 asset classes are U.S. stocks, international stocks, and bonds. You can get exposure to all 3 asset classes using 1 fund, 2 funds, 3 funds, or many more than 3 funds, it's up to you. Most people on this subreddit would say that for someone your age investing for retirement in 30+ years, you actually don't need the bond exposure from a 3-fund portfolio. As a result, you need exposure to U.S. stocks and international stocks. As it happens, VT is a fund that gives you exposure to both U.S. stocks and international stocks, and it automatically rebalances to maintain exposure according to how the U.S. stock market performs relative to the international stock market. So that's what people mean by ""VT and chill,"" because it's a ""one-fund solution"" for people in situations like yours. With that said, inside of a Roth IRA, another great option is a target date index fund (""TDF""). A TDF gives you exposure to all 3 asset classes, i.e., it's as if you had VT + bonds. The nice thing about a TDF is that it starts you off with about 90% stocks and 10% bonds, and then over time, it slowly adjusts the ratio so that you will have more bonds and fewer stocks later in life, which is appropriate for most people as they approach retirement. In many ways, a TDF is more truly a one-fund solution than VT is, because if you only use VT now, then eventually, you will probably want to buy a separate bond fund later when you are older. It all comes back to, how involved do you want to be? If you want a simple solution that could last you your whole life, then going 100% TDF is a great choice. If you want a simple solution that will last you 2-3 decades, but you're okay to check in again later to make some adjustments, then going 100% VT for now is fine. One caveat: if you end up using Vanguard for your IRA, then buy any Vanguard TDF, e.g., the 2065 TDF [here](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vlxvx); but if you end up using Fidelity, make sure you use their \*index\* TDFs, e.g., the 2065 TDF [here](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315796839) \-- don't use Fidelity's \*actively-managed\* TDFs!",1759330812.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1nv9y5l/opening_a_roth/nh736om/

If you're sitting on the sidelines during those days you get left behind. So simply staying invested, beats trying to wait for the next low. Assuming your objective is long term eventual retirement savings.

I went fully invested in 1980 when we were starting out poor and had minimal savings. A high proportion of net income went mostly into an S&P index fund. Then we never got out regardless of market ups and downs, only withdrawing funds for essentials such as new home down payment etc. This allowed me to retire 10 years early in 1998 after a couple of years of extraordinary gains. This was unexpected, I had assumed I would need to work to age 65.

VT contains Total US + Total International. The first two components of the [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio). VXUS is total International again. SGOV is a cash equivalent and probably doesn't belong in your retirement account. IBTI looks like a three-year Treasury bond?

NVDA is already contained in VT. Tilting towards individual companies tends to just introduce [uncompensated risk](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/), which means that you're taking on more risk than investing in a total market index fund, but you can't expect to receive better returns than the market average.

If you sell in a taxable account you will pay taxes on any gains, and if you sell less than a year after buying it's taxed at a higher rate (short term vs long term capital gains). There's no need to panic and sell now, these funds are absolutely fine. Take some time and figure out what you want your allocation to be long term. If you have money to contribute in the meantime, buy according to that allocation. Then, when it's been long enough that you aren't paying short term capital gains, you can sell anything that doesn't align with your desired allocation and buy what you want. The only caveat is that if you just bought these yesterday or something, you can probably sell with minimal fuss since there won't be any significant gains anyway (unless we're talking about a very large amount of money).

Broad,Bogleheads,1nuer6w,Another VTI/VXUS Portfolio Inquiry,nh2s6n5,"For better or for worse, a 10% bond allocation won't have a huge effect on your returns. If stocks go up 15%, your portfolio will go up about 14%. If stocks go down 15%, you will go down about 13%.

That said, when you read generic advice about stock/bond allocations, you should keep in mind that you will have a pension (but not social security?). Pensions and bonds are both fixed income assets, so they play overlapping roles in your retirement portfolio. Many people with a pension choose to hold less of their investments in bonds than their peers without pensions.

Broad,Bogleheads,1nuer6w,Another VTI/VXUS Portfolio Inquiry,nh4swxv,"As others might have told you, your allocation (and how risky it is) is ultimately a personal decision. If you don't think you can stomach the volatility of 100% stocks, then do what you're comfortable with. Even a well-diversified stock portfolio might drop by 50% at some point. Don't put money in stocks you can't afford to lose. Do what you need to do to sleep at night.

All of that said, yes, someone in your position could consider 100% stocks, even without a pension. By the sound of it, you will be in the ""accumulation"" phase of your financial journey for many more years. In that phase, you want to invest aggressively (i.e. buy lots of stocks).

When you enter the ""transition""/""preservation"" phase, you start gradually shifting your investments from, typically, away from 90-100% stocks towards more bonds. Depending on who you ask, that phase might start anytime from 5 to 20 years before retirement. But, really, when it should start should be less about a set timeline and more about how much you've accumulated and what you want for retirement.

And the final phase in this model is ""distribution"", when you stop working and use your savings to fund your life. By that stage, many portfolios would have transitioned to mostly bonds, maybe 50-70% bonds. That is where yours might be different. If your pension can cover most of your income needs, you probably won't need to withdraw as much from your investments, at least in the beginning, and you can keep more in stocks for longer.",1759292826.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1nuer6w/another_vtivxus_portfolio_inquiry/nh4swxv/

Broad,Bogleheads,1ntyaro,Rebalancing Brokerage - Tips and Advice?,ngx8qmq,"Personally I would only hesitate to reallocate in a couple of situations:


- You will soon have space in the 0% capital gains bracket (for example, if you're retiring soon and have low expenses/a large cash cushion and therefore will have low or no taxable income)


- You're currently making enough to be in the 20% capital gains bracket or to pay NIIT, and won't be in the near future.


In both of these situations, waiting a few years could save you a good amount on taxes. Otherwise, if you expect to be in the 15% bracket both now and in retirement, you're just paying some tax earlier rather than later. Selling will reset your cost basis, so you never pay twice. Of course frequently buying/selling means a tax drag (that money you pay now in taxes will not get a chance to compound) but doing it once is no big deal.


The other situation is if you are far from retirement (or any other expected big change to your income tax wise). None of us can predict what the tax code may do in the future, so in that case I'd just go ahead and simplify your life rather than waiting around.


The alternative is to decide on a split between VFIAX and VXUS that you like and put the new contribution in such that it creates the correct percentages, and then any future contributions will be at that same ratio. This requires no sale and no tax consequences and you can simulate VT if you want.

With that being said, it's a fairly simple assessment of how much risk you're willing to tolerate and how much diversification you want to have. For me, I'm going the three fund route of total US market, total international market, and total us bond market. Honestly with how young I am, I probably won't need to bother investing in bonds at all.

So, the assessment I've made with myself is that I am

1. Willing to go 100% into stocks, an aggressive portfolio
2. Willing to hedge that the US market will continue to perform-- and outperform the international market, to the point of having it being 70% of my total portfolio.
3. Will want to diversify further, and have 30% of my portfolio as international funds, especially after some of the more recent domestic fiascos we've been having with the economy.

And perhaps I'll review this statement/assessment from time to time and maybe decide that I should perhaps lean more into the international market for more safety, or get into bonds when I become \~60 and close to retirement.

1. Determine your goals

Figure out how much you want in stocks, bonds, and (for some goals) cash, and how much of your stocks you want to be US versus international. From there, a bit of simple math gets you your target portfolio.

Step 3, determining which funds to use and buying them, is really the easiest. You've done well on half of this: All the funds you've chosen are good, but you appear to have bought them without putting them into your broader picture.

Broad,Bogleheads,1nt8z68,How to safely manage my 66-year-old mom’s retirement?,nhkeykh,"Pushing back a little against the idea that ""her investment allocation is very aggressive for her age"". If you only consider her own invested funds (which are roughly 85% stocks), then yes maybe. But once you factor in the fixed income portion from her Social Security (which currently covers 20% of her expenses, and likely more than 50% in a few years), and optionally the added pension, then her overall asset allocation is much more conservative. 

Back of the envelope, a $3500/month Social Security payout could roughly be seen as a 4% coupon on a $1 million dollar bond allocation. So her overall asset allocation is now only around 52% stocks (i.e. 0.85 \*1.6 / 2.6). Just as a coarse approximation of course, but you get the point.

Similarly, my mother (who lives in Europe and gets a generous pension covering \~80% of her spending needs) also invests her liquid assets in 80% stocks 20% bonds, but once you factor in the pension, she's closer to 40/60. All else equal, if your portfolio only has to cover a fraction of your spending needs, you can invest it more aggressively.

Broad,Bogleheads,1nt8z68,How to safely manage my 66-year-old mom’s retirement?,ngyejiw,"Thank you for your in-depth advice. I am definitely gonna get a fee only CFP. I don’t know how it will go, but once I find one that I like, I would even be opening to do an annual visit with my mom just to make her feel comfortable and pay for the visit. The pension does get reevaluated every April to adjust for inflation so I don’t know my mom is healthy and I hope that she lives well into her 80s. I’m definitely in agreement to the 3 to 5 years in emergency cash(bonds etc). I’m leaning more towards three just because I guess I’m a little more risky and I personally have flexibility to help. If something really goes down. I do need to address my sister, but maybe a financial planner to broach that topic.

If the daughter isn’t pay half the mortgage and lives there rent free that’s an issue IMO.

Broad,Bogleheads,1nt7ve4,Current Portfolio (29m - guidance?),ngw28l8,"International at any point - that's just about diversifying further than the US. You don't absolutely have to, but the reason a lot of people give for not doing so is the recent outperformance of the US, which is not guaranteed. If you own everything, you get a piece of the pie in years when international outperforms. The current market split is about 63% US 37% international at market weights, but various percentages are common to hold.


Bonds (ideally) reduce volatility, which is important as you approach the point where you want to start withdrawing the money. But they also reduce expected returns, so shifting too far into them too early can mean you have to save more than you would if you had been more aggressive. The conservative benchmark often quoted is your age in bonds (as a percentage) but I think that leans very conservative. Age minus 10 or 20 probably works better. If your retirement date is more flexible (for example, if you plan to retire early), you could wait longer to shift - the reason to shift gradually over time is that if you shift all at once near the end, you could get unlucky and have a market crash right before you do so, which would mean you end up selling stocks for much less. By shifting gradually, the risk is spread out over a decade or two without dropping returns too much.",1759177536.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1nt7ve4/current_portfolio_29m_guidance/ngw28l8/
