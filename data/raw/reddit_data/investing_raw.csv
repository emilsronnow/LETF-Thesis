n6ohnuw,"Historically, 2x leverage has outperformed the underlying S&P 500 index. The part most people underestimate is just how difficult the volatility can be on an investor’s emotions. It must be experienced firsthand to truly know where your risk tolerance is. With that said, I do think the prevailing negative narrative around these instruments is overblown. They can be incredibly useful when harnessed wisely.

n6ovpyj,"If you had actually read up on leveraged etfs you'd know that on a longer time scale they don't exactly replicate the underlying. Since they're based on derivatives that expire and need to be rolled over or adjusted to maintain the leverage on a day to day basis leveraged ETFs are meant to be trading instruments for day trading or short term holding. If you hold a leveraged ETF long term it won't actually maintain its leverage across that entire period. They also have higher fees that eat into your own profits.

Depending on how you trade them you need a much higher risk tolerance than buying and holding a non leveraged ETF since the wild swings work both ways.

And again I ask, what have you been reading about them if you're missing the most basic elements of them? Literally just compare the chart of QQQ and TQQQ. You can see that over the different time scales the divergence is immediately apparent without even having to go that far back.

if the underlying asset goes up 5% you get 10%, but if it goes down 5% you’re down 10%, then the underlying asset **has to go up 12%** for you to break even again (this isn’t 100% accurate but a rough estimate to illustrate the concept). 

This is because the leverage the ETF provides is mechanically based off of options that expire daily. So the levered position is reset daily. 

As the asset moves up and down (volatility) you will lose that leverage. You will not see the 2x leverage in your portfolio overtime even-though you’re taking 2x risk.

ncao6fi,"You got and will get a ton of uninformed answers from people simply regurgitating what they have heard about LETFs.  Some of their comments will contain half truths, others will be a complete waste of the electricity used to store them on reddit servers.

Here are the truths:

* LETFs do amplify the returns you get.
* LETFs do reset daily.
* LETFs do diverge from the returns of the underlying index over time, both to the positive and negative sides.

You aren’t missing anything but you have to understand that last bullet point.  If you buy a LETF now and the index declines it is going to take you longer to recover than it will take the index to recover.  That’s how LETFs diverge from their underlying index due to the fact that they reset daily.  Ultimately that is all the result of the amplification of LETFs.

In your case, 40+ years, that isn’t a real problem.  Even if you buy at the all time high and the index takes a dump you will ultimately recover and outperform the index unless the index flatlines for those 40 years or has multiple major corrections.  The chance the index will do that is basically zero when you are talking about a major index like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, or Dow Jones Industrials.

There is a risk in holding LETFs for the long term but there is a risk with anything, so you aren’t really increasing your risk if you buy a LETF which is based on a major index. The real challenge with LETFs is the human.  Take for example, the recent market drops in 2025 and  2022.  In both those drops if you had held onto a LETF which you bought in 2018, you would have seen it drop below your original investment baseline.  The vast majority of people in such a situation would absolutely panic and sell and, of course, on both occasions they would have realized a loss and not participated in the subsequent recovery.

The question with LETFs isn’t whether or not they can be a viable investment vehicle.  The question is, do you have the right time horizon (yes, you do) and do you have the emotional fortitude to stomach future corrections?  So you need to ask yourself what you would do if you put $20,000 in a LETF to see that rise to $100,000 and then fall to $10,000.  There’s a very good chance that will happen.  If you are 100% certain you will not panic sell then you are a candidate for using LETFs.

ncaclex,"A little leverage for someone young is not a terrible idea. 

However, sitting in SPXL is a terrible idea. 

First, look up volatility decay. You get approximately 3x the DAILY return. This could be wildly different from the yearly. For example, in the last year the S&P is up 14% and SPXL is up 22%. 

You will get nothing like 40% appreciation. Even if the S&P returned 13% over the long term, which it has not historically and is incredibly unlikely to do in the future, you won’t get 40%. See above. 

Second, you are likely to get wiped out. If the market is down 30%, which it is periodically, you will be down 90% if not get totally wiped out. 

Third, most people simply can’t stomach volatility like that. So even if somehow everything worked beautifully, you, statistically speaking, are likely to panic when the inevitable 60% drop comes and sell out. 

All that said, if you just took out a margin loan for like 25-30% of your SPY position and used it to buy more SPY you probably would end up with a better result than buy and hold.

# Lifecycle Investing: A New, Safe, and Audacious Way to Improve the Performance of Your Retirement Portfolio

Ian Ayres and Barry Nalebuff

In my experience, nakedly investing in leveraged index ETFs works until it doesn't.  That is, you can have tremendous gains, but then give them all back.  You need to have some portion of the portfolio that is a hedge and rebalance a couple times a year.  Hedges are long treasuries (ZROZ), gold (GLDM) and potentially managed futures (CTA).  

Play around with different mixes on testfol.io.  Really look closely at the 1970s or 2007/8 and consider your total leverage (amount of UPRO or SPUU) in the mix.  It isn't going to be hard to run a leveraged portfolio in times like today.  But imagine things going down and staying down for five years or longer.  That will happen.  It's guaranteed over your investing lifespan.  Multiple times.  Whatever portfolio you run, you need to believe in it strongly enough by doing the work so that you stick with it when the shit hits the fan.  Which it will.",1756957425,2,investing,1n7uw7b,/r/investing/comments/1n7uw7b/whats_wrong_with_a_23_year_old_investing_into_a/ncbc969/

For example you invest in an unleveraged ETF for $100:  
Underlying assets gain 10%, and you now have $110.  
Then the day after that, they lose 10%. Now you have $99.

Now with a 2x leveraged ETF:  
Underlying assets gain 10%, you have $120.  
Then lose 10%, you have $96.

Lets say you decide to put X dollars in TQQQ in 1999 (it didn't exist then, but lets pretend). Then the 2000 thing happened. 

The Nasdaq 100 dropped about 83%.

Now for the fun part. Triple -83% is ________?

Lets do the same thing in 2008.

QQQ (which did exist -- not TQQQ) dropped about 42% in 2008.

Triple -42% is __________. 


Lets say a person hypothetically started putting 1000/month dollars away in TQQQ (which didn't exist then) in 1970. By 2008, you would have ZERO dollars. 

38 years of investing and you would be at zero dollars.

To be fair, if you did that up until today, you would have about a million bucks if you invested 1000/month since its inception date in 2010. So... in 2025 you would have just over a million bucks if you followed this strategy like a religion. 

Had you been investing in a hypothetical SPY from 1970 on the same amount, you would have several million.

To be clear, we can really use any starting date before 2000, as you would be zeroed out with that bubble and then again in 2008. Oh... yeah, you would have been wiped out in 1987, as well.

h62qq1u,"Leverage is generally misunderstood.  It does work both ways as pointed out. If you leverage a bad investment and rebalance frequently you will lose a ton. If you leverage a good investment and re-leverage frequently you can actually add to the returns because you are compounding on compounding.  This can all be confusing but it is a basic idea in finance.

I must point out it is quite easy to create your own leveraged ETF by buying an ETF in a margin account (preferably an account with a low margin rate like Fed Funds plus a small increment).  I've backtested leveraged ETFs (results are on my free wordpress under DailyScreenz) and even with a little leverage and paying a financing cost the returns  compare favorably to the average hedge fund........Happy Hunting!",1626917382,14,investing,ooxu94,/r/investing/comments/ooxu94/debunking_the_leveraged_etfs_are_not_a_longterm/h62qq1u/
h622xg3,"While technically true that B&H leveraged ETF in theory will net you huge gains, MOST people will panic when they see their account draw down 40, 50, 60%+ and be unable to ride out the volatility long term.  

So maybe this could work if you don't check your account for 30 years, or just allocate a portion of your account to it.  

There's actually nothing wrong with using leverage in general.  Kelly criterion suggests optimal leverage of around 1.5-2x for a portfolio depending on mix of stocks and bonds.  

The best way to construct a levered portfolio is to hold a bunch of uncorrelated assets such that your expected risk adj returns are good, then lever it up judiciously.  

Applying huge leverage to a 100% stock portfolio is a terrible idea because there could easily be 90% drawdowns that take a decade+ to recover from.  

IMO no retail investor should use anything more than 2x leverage, and that too with a risk management plan (such as momentum/trend), or with broad diversification across asset classes.

Take a simplistic example of a fund that has a 50% chance of a 10% gain and a 50% chance of a 10% loss on any given day. A 2x fund that is rebalanced daily will of course go up (U) or down (D) 20% in any given day. Comparing returns of the unlevered and the levered funds over 2 days:

UU: 1.1 * 1.1-1 = 21% unlevered return vs 1.2 * 1.2-1 = 44% levered return. More than 2x the return

UD or DU: -1% unlevered vs -4% levered. Worse than 2x the loss

DD: -19% unlevered vs -36% levered. Better than 2x the loss.

Same general principle extends to more than 2 periods, or to the continuous case.

h65zu37,"1) its not a myth, its a statement on the prospectus written by the managers of leveraged ETFs. 

2) you cant backtest leveraged ETFs, because they don't just take the fund and open a margin account. They engage in all kinds of weird and wonderful things like swaps and derivatives. 

3) You cant really model the portfolio turnover that might happen. You cant model trading halt risks, where the fund is unable to rebalance. You cant model the complex tax situations that might arise from index volatility.

if you DCA 500$/month in each fund since inception, here are the TWRRs.

EET>6.08%; VWO>7.21%

XPP>1.92%; FXI>3.99%

EFO>9.88; IEFA>8.24 (about even before covid)

In low interest rate environments this can be ignored.  But if the federal funds rate is 5%, a 3x etf will lose about 10% a year just  due to that. Leverage is not free. Futures index prices have significant contango drag  in high interest rate environments .. 

But this may be negated to some extent by dividend yields. 3x etfs do not pay dividends,so the dividend is automatically imputed to the NAV, usually daily very slightly.

I'm a believer in buying the dip, but I have to ask how long have you been investing and what's your account size?  Reason is that 1) people who started investing after 2009 have never experienced a prolonged bear market and buying the dip has been handsomely rewarded, and 2) it is easier psychologically to deal with 40% drawdowns in a small account.  When you're swinging 500k or 1M+ in the future will be much harder to stick through that unrealized loss.  Just food for thought.

h65bzm6,"The rule would vary by personal strategy and risk tolerance, but something like that.  There are infinite variations of this strategy you could use.  The general idea would be to use more leverage when the market is low, and reduce that leverage when the market is high.  

Lets say you wanted to use this strategy with spy and spy3x. A simple example of this strategy would be something along the lines of 1. every time spy all time high increases by 5%- sell 10% of spy3x and buy 10% spy.  2. When spy is 5% below all time high- sell 10% of spy and purchase 10% spy3x.   The same type of strategy could be used with your bond portfolio.  

Another variation of this strategy using SPY3x and TMF(3x bond fund) might be something along the lines of- when SPY3x all time high has increased by 5% and TMF is 5% below its all time high, you sell 10% of your SPY3x position and purchase 10% more of your TMF position.

Using a strategy like this would probably require tuning and maintenance depending on the markets.  Having a program for the strategy would probably make things much easier.  Also. Given the potential for short term trades, I think this method might best be used in something like a Roth IRA where you don't face short term cap gains(if in the US).

h631zwf,"Is there significant cash drag with futures? Say I want to trade futures in a well funded IRA at a regular retail brokerage. There's no tax considerations, but I wouldn't be able to add much cash to the account. As I understand it, brokers require a cash position in the account to cover losses, and that figure is even higher in an IRA.

If I have $50 invested in the S&P 500 at 2x leverage, and have to keep $50 as cash, wouldn't that portfolio perform the same as if it was $100 invested at $0 leverage? The only catch would be any additional transaction fees, interest rates on the cash, inflation, etc. Can the margin be stored as a security (e.g,. a treasury bond), or does it have to be cash? I know most brokerages make most of their revenue off of net interest income where they lend out your cash positions and give you a low interest rate.

That being said, I've heard futures are extremely liquid. How big are the bid-ask spreads compared to ETFs like SPY or leveraged ETFs like UPRO? What about other transaction costs?

How about in ""shorting the box?"" Your link has an example with SPX where it's a 0.48% borrow rate. The fine print lists transaction costs, fees, commissions, etc. as potential concerns.

Personally, I think the biggest advantage of standard 1x funds is that they have very low costs. Las Vegas is built on a tiny house advantage compounded over time. If there is a way to get cheap leverage with very low transaction costs, then this seems like a good move.  But I don't want a cheap margin position that requires an expensive cash position to match.

As a final point, it seems like stock picking doesn't have the diversification benefits of an index fund, but liquid stocks have limited transaction fees. Is that a more cost effective way to bear increased risk?",1626923029,2,investing,ooxu94,/r/investing/comments/ooxu94/debunking_the_leveraged_etfs_are_not_a_longterm/h631zwf/

h649j0l,"I personally do not trade futures, so I don't have experience there. However, my understanding is the same as yours regarding the cash drag of holding them in an IRA. I don't think there's an effective way to use them to lever up a retirement account, but I could be wrong.

As you mentioned, futures are very liquid and their bid-ask spreads are tiny, typically even lower than SPY. Thus, low transactions costs. It's the tax considerations that have kept me away from them.

There are a lot of concerns you should have if you decide to short a box, but transactions costs is not one of them IMO. I use this financing method, and transactions costs are negligible. Keep in mind that all you are doing is buying or selling 4 options contracts - commissions might be a couple dollarsish, depending on your broker. Spreads are of course an implicit cost, but I (and others) can borrow at very low rates (I'm borrowing around 0.8% for about a year and a half term), and that rate ""includes"" the costs I paid through spreads. Buying or selling boxes is a common institutional practice, and I believe this helps keep these options liquid. An added benefit is that your interest here is a capital loss, which is great for tax purposes.

If you do decide to sell a box, make sure you know what you're doing and research it beforehand. You need a portfolio margin account to make it work, and you also have to be sure you use European style options (I use SPX - NOT SPY). Some people have had problems with them at IBKR (search ""Interactive Brokers autoliquidate"" or something like that at EliteTrader), so seller beware there. Tbh my default position is to dissuade people from using the strategy, when straight margin at IBKR is not that much more expensive.

I agree with you 100% on the expenses of leveraged funds, and that is what keeps me from using them. I'm not saying people shouldn't use them, but those expenses are high enough to keep me away.

Regarding your final point - keep in mind that the market does not directly compensate you for risks associated with being underdiversified. So you have to have a very good reason to remain underdiversified. For most people who go this route, they feel they can generate alpha, and if you feel like you can generate alpha through stock picking, then individual stock picking can be a way to increase returns through increased risk. However, IMO most people are deluding themselves with this train of thought.

h66rlp0,"says here:

Assume a passively managed fund seeks to track the performance of the S&P 500. The asset managers of the fund could enter into an equity swap contract, so it would not have to purchase various securities that track the S&P 500. The firm swaps $25 million at LIBOR plus two basis points with an investment bank that agrees to pay any percentage increase in $25 million invested in the S&P 500 index for one year. 

doing this with 3-1 leverage presumably would cost at least 2x libor 

so if the fund has $25 million, it would invest that $25 million in qqq and pay nothing. but to get the 3-1 leverage req. 2x swap, so 2x libor. 

or invest the $25 million in short -term bonds, collect the interest, and then  use 3x swap leverage. same result.

h64l2y2,"On this last point, my logic is that it's a bit like roulette. Say there is an American style board with a 0 and 00 board. Your odds of winning on any given number is 1/38. On a European style board with just a 0 style board is 1/37. And on a French style board, your chances of winning are slightly higher still. If you bet on black or red on an American board, your odds of winning are 18/38. This is the most ""diversified"" position in the game. But a more concentrated bet on a European style board with a lower house advantage actually results in a better risk/reward profile for the player. Logically, a 10% chance of winning $100 is equal to a 100% chance of winning $10. So even tiny transaction fees would make the difference between these two circumstances, especially when compounded over many years.

The stock market corollary would be that randomly picking a stock and buying with low transaction costs might be a better way to take on more risk/reward than paying a higher fee/cost to leverage up an index. The irony is that this relies on believing that securities are always efficiently priced according to the efficient market hypothesis. If you think you can generate alpha by purposefully picking stocks, it potentially biases you towards buying overpriced stocks.

So the market is +10%, 2x leverage would be 20-6=14%, and 3x leverage is 30-12=18%. So sure you made more than the unleveraged underlying in this example, if the market was +5% for instance the 3x leveraged version with 6% cost would net +3%.

Apparently M1 Finance is popular, will do leveraged ETFs and can automatically rebalance for you. I’m gonna try and transfer my  small Roth IRA there from vanguard when I get time…

I should also say lots of people are worried about rising interest rates with TMF, some people have looked at shorter term leveraged bond funds (like 10, 20 yr instead of the 30 year in TMF). But I forget the tickers. But the main guy is still doing TMF and UPRO since 2019. I’m probably just going to go with that as well. 

There is also a 1.5x leveraged ETF NTSX that’s popular because it’s a combination of bonds/sp500 but you don’t have to rebalance so could hold in a taxable account. I believe you can also buy it at vanguard. Here’s [a thread on NTSX](https://amp.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/j3bb8a/ntsx_9060_sp500bonds_pros_and_cons/)

h65yzbg,"No you would be down less than 100%. If SPY went down 15% each day for 3 days in a row each day UPRO would go down 45% each day. So starting at $100 on day 1: 

SPY: $100 -> $85 -> $72.25 -> $61.41 = -38.59%

UPRO: $100 -> $55 -> $30.25 -> $16.64 = -83.36%

So yes, very bad results obviously, but actually less than 3x the negative results of SPY because of the daily reset.

Conversely because of the daily reset multiple days of gains can net you greater than 3x positive returns. Let's look at 3 days of 3% gains on SPY:

SPY: $100 -> $103 -> $106.09 -> $109.27 = +9.27%

UPRO: $100 -> $109 -> $118.81 -> $129.50 = +29.5%

In this case UPRO does better than 3x SPY due to the daily reset!

Where leveraged funds underperform their reference fund is when there is volatility on a daily time frame, so one day up, the next down and so on and so forth.

As an example, SPY goes up 5% one day and 5% down the next.

SPY: $100 -> $105 -> $99.75 = -0.25%

UPRO: $100 -> $115 -> $97.75 = -2.25%

In this example UPRO underperforms the underlying index.

h65ueiq,"Yes, the cost of the leverage is reflected in the value of the fund over time.

Right now ESU21, the September futures for SPX, is trading at 4359. It matures in 57 days. The S&P 500 index at the same time is 4367.5. The futures price is a combination of adjusting lower for dividends (you receive no dividends from the futures but you would if you owned, e.g., SPY) and adjusting higher for the interest rate. 4359 - 4367.5 = -8.5, which is -0.2% of SPX over a period of 57 days. If you purely annualized that number, you'd get about -1.3%. But that -1.3% is again the result of netting the dividend yield you miss out on, and we haven't accounted for that yet. The long term average dividend yield is about 1.9%, and the current forward yield is closer to 1.4%. So you can back into the implied financing rate of using futures as somewhere in the range of 0.1% - 0.6%, and it's likely closer to 0.1%. And that makes sense, because the current 1 month Libor rate is about 0.1%, and the 1 year Libor rate is 0.25%. Here's data for 3 month Libor since 1986: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USD3MTD156N](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USD3MTD156N)

The idea of a futures position is that your total return from a fully collateralized position (i.e., no leverage) should be the same as your total return from holding the underlying outright. So if you took on a $1 million notional futures position and posted $1 million in collateral, you should anticipate earning some Libor-esque return on your collateral and a price-only return on the futures. But the futures price you enter into will be lower than (SPX * (1 + risk free rate)) due to the dividend yield you don't get, thus you enter into a price at (SPX * (1 + risk free rate - dividend yield)). Since the dividend yield is currently higher than the risk free rate, SPX futures are priced lower than SPX. When the risk free rate is higher than the dividend yield, the futures price is also higher than the underlying, but it is still lower than purely adjusting for the interest rate.

Let's pretend you have no collateral hypothetically. When you buy ESU21, you don't transfer any cash, you just pick up the exposure and ""lock in"" the execution price. So at the moment that would mean, again, you're locking in a price that's 8.5 points lower than the underlying index. In 57 days when the contract matures, it will settle at exactly the value of SPX -- so however many points the index moves, you'll get that exact same movement, plus you picked up 8.5 points from the execution price. If the index doesn't move at all (price return = 0), you will settle at 4367.5 in 57 days and therefore make a return of that 0.2% difference (1.3% annualized). But 1.3% annualized yield is lower than the index's dividend yield, so you underperformed the index. If we assume the current dividend yield is about 1.4%, then you are losing 0.1% (~1-3 month Libor) per $1 million notional.

Now let's talk about the 3x leveraged case. Your portfolio is $333k, which you post as cash collateral to fund your $1 million notional futures position. Your cash makes 0.1%/year and your futures position makes (SPX return - 0.1%)/year. In dollar terms, your cash is earning $333 but your futures position costs you $1000, netting to $667 loss for holding the position over a year. This is a pretty optimistic case because Libor is so low right now, and the assumption of 1.4% dividend yield might be a little low (dividend cash amounts don't move nearly as quickly as prices do, so if prices fall the dividend yield will rise quickly, and that will work against you). That net $667 loss represents a 0.2% annualized borrowing cost for you (2x Libor). If you were, e.g., 10x levered, then you would be paying 9x Libor (which is again only 1% total as of today) as a percentage of your portfolio size in borrowing costs (sticking with $1 million notional, this means $1000 interest on the futures position, $100k collateral earning $100 at 0.1%, net cost of $900/year on $100k portfolio size).

Shit gets very real very fast when Libor isn't close to 0, and especially when it rises quickly. In December 2015, 3 month Libor was 0.6%. So you could have been 3x levered with futures and paid an effective borrowing rate of about 1.2%. This also assumes you're actually earning Libor on your cash collateral -- if your brokerage is giving you something worse, e.g., 0% or 0.01% today wouldn't be uncommon, then you're really paying the full 3x cost because the futures financing rate is higher than your own collateral return rate, so you aren't offsetting it. But we'll stick to the ideal case and say 3x leverage means your net borrowing cost is 2x Libor. So in December 2015 you're having a grand time earning 3x market - 1.2%, except that borrowing costs float, and by December 2016 3 month Libor has risen to 1%. Now you're earning 3x market - 2%. By December 2017 3 month Libor reaches 1.7%. Now you're earning 3x market - 3.4%. By December 2018 3 month Libor reaches 2.8%. Now you're earning 3x market - 5.6%. It gets harder and harder to justify this leverage the higher interest rates get, and if rising rates are coupled with a falling equity market, you will wind up bankrupt eventually. And again, when you look back to the early 2000s you'll find Libor rates exceeding 5% (3x leverage means 3x market - 10%), and in the 1980s rates would have exceeded 10% at some points (3x market - *20%*).

Posts like this one that claim leverage has never led to ruin are just objectively fucking wrong, and I wish they would stop. I don't have a problem with leverage, but I do have a problem with shitty science. OP's ""backtest"" isn't a backtest. It doesn't simulate what the return of a leveraged ETF would have been with any realism at all. So it is absolutely useless as a justification for the safety of leverage, because the risk of ruin does exist, it isn't close to 0, and people will get fucked. Does anyone really think that hedge funds run by PhDs from prestigious universities run out of money in their leveraged strategies and shut down for any reason that isn't attributable to market dynamics? Surely these people are at least as intelligent as a guy who wrote a Python script one time with freely available index data. So how come they don't reach the same conclusion in practice -- that you can't possibly lose -- that this dude on the internet did?

h66cj6c,"I love the StocksPLUS family. They are exposed 100% to S&P 500 passively and manage a fixed income portfolio actively. You could kinda sorta do the same thing yourself by buying SPX futures and a vanilla PIMCO bond mutual fund, but they do all the rebalancing legwork on your behalf and 1 SPX contract is a tiny unit in the scope of a billion dollar portfolio -- much less tiny for small rebalancing in a retail account. In some sense you can picture this fund as being fully collateralized, but with risky collateral. The objective is really to say ""I am going to put up $1 for every $1 of stock exposure I have, but instead of earning Libor on my collateral, I want to try to fetch a higher return."" Maybe it pans out and maybe it doesn't, but the net result is a portfolio that ends up being S&P 500 plus an alpha that is determined by the difference between the fixed income portfolio and Libor (the borrowing cost of the futures). You could do the same thing with any futures, really -- replace SPX with gold futures and now you have an entire GoldPLUS fund family instantly, for example. And since the fixed income portfolio *should*, if they're doing their job, be correlated with the borrowing cost (you expect to have a portfolio whose yields will increase when the risk free rate increases, so you should still be beating the borrowing cost long term forever), variations in Libor aren't a huge concern. That said, long duration is a riskier portfolio than some others, but not as bad as being pure 2x SPX. I occasionally manage my personal portfolio in a similar fashion: SPX futures and/or ITM calls giving me 100% or less total exposure plus a ""collateral"" portfolio of corporate bonds.",1626989700,2,investing,ooxu94,/r/investing/comments/ooxu94/debunking_the_leveraged_etfs_are_not_a_longterm/h66cj6c/

Firms have been running portable alpha strategies with futures for decades, but the typical person looks at a list of holdings with 300 bond positions, 1 line that says ""S&P 500 futures,"" and walks away because they don't get it.

It outlines the benefits and risks of using leverage over long term periods (going back to 1928 - 2020), and concludes that if you can combine the leverage with a very simple mechanism for reducing drawdown, the risk weighted return can be significant.   Anyone who only points to the volatility decay is ignoring the compounding returns of a bull market that can be mind boggling.  As a simple exercise, go to yahoo finance and chart UPRO for the past 10 years against the S&P.  It's a little bit more than 3x :). 

Ultimately it comes down to what type of risk appetite you have.  Are you comfortable with a strategy that brings a potential significant drawdown for the benefit of the power of compounding?  

And with that risk, there is an element of timing.  We're at all time high valuations, with significant liquidity in the market, and a FED that is signalling rate hikes in the next couple of years.  IMO the potential for a correction is much higher than it was 5 years ago, so there's some caution to be had.",1635539520,141,investing,qihvrk,/r/investing/comments/qihvrk/leveraged_etfs_whats_been_your_experience/hik592y/

hiky08r,"I made a new account to share my experience since I'm giving personal details.

Back in April 2020 I invested $30k in a leveraged ETF portfolio. Over the next few months I built up to a $42k cost basis. That has since grown to $101k.

The allocation I'm using currently is 30% UPRO, 15% TQQQ, 15% SOXL, 40% TMF, rebalanced monthly. I had a different allocation with less TMF at first, but settled on this around the beginning of this year. That was after reading Hedgefundie's post and running my own extended backtest simulating what UPRO and TMF would have done before they existed. I found that a mix around 50/50 was optimal and significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period from 1962 to the present (at the cost of much higher volatility, obviously).

The initial amount I invested was about 15% of my net worth at the time, and what it's grown to is about 18% of my current net worth. I wouldn't be comfortable having too much of my net worth in this.

The simulated UPRO/TMF mix performed poorly in the 60s and 70s, driven by the leveraged losses in long term bond prices. So there's a risk of underperformance if we enter another rising interest rate environment.

I'm somewhat concerned about high PE ratios (specifically how Shiller CAPE is negatively correlated with future stock market returns). When I get some time I plan to do some analysis of historical data (or maybe simulated data with the same correlation) to try to figure out if the strategy still has positive expected value in the current environment.",1635552040,2,investing,qihvrk,/r/investing/comments/qihvrk/leveraged_etfs_whats_been_your_experience/hiky08r/

[http://www.ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php](http://www.ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php)

&#x200B;

Some acedemic papers and articles that show that if you're young and have a long time horizon, then you're better off relying on leverage.

&#x200B;

""There is nothing magic about the leverage value 1. There is no mathematical reason for returns to suddenly level off at that leverage. The myth propagators are wrong. Leveraged ETFs can be held long term (unless you think that 135 years isn’t long term).""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Both papers suggest that  2-2.25x leverage has historically provided the best risk adjusted returns for the past 100+ years.

&#x200B;

Personally my strategy for the tech portion of my portfolio is to be 50% in QQQ and 50% in TQQQ.

When a correction or a crash happens I'll be more inclined to  DCA when the 3x levered ETF is at its lowest. When markets are at ATH I'm more inclined to DCA into the 1x leverage, and avoiding buying TQQQ when it's at its highest..

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Just note that both papers suggest that as you get older and get closer to retirement, you should rely less on leverage.

&#x200B;

Imagine retiring right when the dot com bubble popped and having a significant portion in TQQQ (if it had existed then). You would be screwed. Whereas if you still had 10-12 years left in retirement, this would have be a golden opportunity to buy at the bottom.

&#x200B;

UPRO (3x s&p 500) and TQQQ averaged 33% and 55% YoY since the beginning of those bull runs. SPY averaged 12% and QQQ averaged only 20% YoY.",1635539790,45,investing,qihvrk,/r/investing/comments/qihvrk/leveraged_etfs_whats_been_your_experience/hik5x9e/

However in the 5 years that have passed, the ETFs I spoke of have gone up between 700% and 1400%. Thankfully (at least so far) I decided to ignore conventional wisdom and just let it ride to today. I continue to perform very well today. Each year I transition more of my 3X leveraged shares into 2X, and after a certain point soon I will be moving the 2X shares into more stable funds that follow the overall market, hopefully getting to retirement much faster than I thought.",1635540102,45,investing,qihvrk,/r/investing/comments/qihvrk/leveraged_etfs_whats_been_your_experience/hik6p8n/

>ETFs are funds that contain a basket of securities that are from the index that they track. For example, ETFs that track the S&P 500 Index will contain the 500 stocks in the S&P. Typically, if the S&P moves 1%, the ETF will also move by 1%.

>**A leveraged ETF that tracks the S&P might use financial products and debt that magnify each 1% gain in the S&P to a 2% or 3% gain. The extent of the gain is contingent on the amount of leverage used in the ETF. Leveraging is an investing strategy that uses borrowed funds to buy options and futures to increase the impact of price movements.**

>However, leverage can work in the opposite direction as well and lead to losses for investors. If the underlying index falls by 1%, the loss is magnified by the leverage. Leverage is a double-edged sword meaning it can lead to significant gains, but it can also lead to significant losses...

>**A leveraged ETF might use derivatives such as options contracts to magnify the exposure to a particular index. It does not amplify the annual returns of an index but instead tracks the daily changes.** Options contracts grant an investor ability to trade an underlying asset without the obligation that they must buy or sell the security. Options contracts have an expiration date by which any action must be completed.

So saying ""the bonds are actually uncorrelated"" is wrong either way unless you're talking about specific bonds which have a correlation of 0 (AKA uncorrelated) with stocks. If that's the case, then I'd love to know which bonds you're talking about.",1635610347,2,investing,qihvrk,/r/investing/comments/qihvrk/leveraged_etfs_whats_been_your_experience/hino76o/

hindjk9,"It comes down to emotional biases. Indeed, depending on the backtesting period, maximum gains is achieved somewhere between 70-30 and 100-0 depending on if the market is at ATHs or not. Right now, I think 100-0 probably yields the most or close to it whereas back when I started researching this in April 2020 it was closer to 65-35 even. Of course, this was during a time when UPRO and TQQQ were down more than 50% from their highs. 

The point is though that the difference between the returns of a 70-30 portfolio and a 100-0 one really are not that different all things considered. If the market co-operates for say 10+ years and you stick with this for that same period of time, you are going to be a multi-millionaire regardless, does it really matter whether you have $2.1M in your account or $1.9M? (This is based on backtesting $10K w/ $1K monthly contributions from Jan 2011 to Oct. 2021. 100-0 vs. 70-30 UPRO/TMF) 

We are all human and what is far more likely is that another Covid drop will happen again, and I do not want to be standing there with my pants down fully exposed to UPRO and TQQQ and watch this thing drop 65%+. If you think you can handle that without tinkering or selling or doimg anything else other than hold, by all means. But talk is cheap, can you walk the walk? 

And for what? So you can get less than an extra $200K on $2M? One mistake during a drawdown period and 10+ years of work diligently holding is ruined. You must stay the course. I sleep very well at night knowing I have contingency plans in place (like holding a decent chunk of TMF) but also some cash in an accessible LOC that I can quickly inject into the portfolio to buy up more UPRO/TQQQ in a crash rather than panicking and selling at the worst possible moment. Going 100-0 just ain't worth it.

Edit: I realize now I had swapped the 100-0 and 70-30 portfolios in my backtest. The 70-30 comes out $200K *ahead* of 100-0 under these circumstances.

n3x2ha7,"So yes. Backtests confirm that leverage will probably outperform without leverage. And that advantage compounds over time. And I personally think most people are overly risk averse. I use leverage myself and am probably leveraged around 1.5x the market.

However, there are caveats here that make this much less clear than it might seem when you just “look at upro all time chart and thinking you’ve cracked how to get rich”

Firstly, people always talk about volatility decay, but they don’t mention the underlying costs of how the leverage is achieved. The funds have to borrow at short term interest rates to achieve their leverage. So for 2x leverage they’re borrowing at about 4.5% per year or so, and for 3x it’s double that at 9%. This plus there is around a 1% expense ratio. (I believe the costs do subtract dividends, but I’m not entirely sure how that factors into this).

If you account for this, doing a basic backtest from 1950-today gives the following 

https://testfol.io/?s=3LWZl6MyChh

2x and 3x leverage do outperform 1x. 11.5% CAGR for 1x and 14.5% CAGR for 2x. But 2x actually outperforms 3x slightly.

Maybe this is different on different timescales, I just chose 1950 randomly, but that’s beyond the point. SPY has outperformed in the last 7 decades over other countries, so this is a somewhat biased sample anyway.

So take all this with what you will.

I guess just keep in mind the following. If you’re going to use leverage, it ONLY makes sense to leverage if you are already all in on the stock market and want to go more into it. 

If you have any cash holding for “safety”, LETFS are OBJECTIVELY worse than holding more of the underlying (because of the expense ratio).

So if you already don’t feel you can stomach going all in on the stock market, then you can’t stomach letfs.",1752886761,3,investing,1m2hfr9,/r/investing/comments/1m2hfr9/why_is_upro_a_bad_investment/n3x2ha7/

n3p4vfw,"That’s a slightly shortsighted analysis. The volatility decay for sideways and volatile markets works against the LETFs the most, however LETFs also generate compounding multiplied gains during bull markets that go far beyond their daily leverage. During extended periods of upwards movements, a 3x LETF can compound to far more than 3x gains like during the 2010s bull market. Example of 3x leverage becoming over 5x gains despite the volatility decay and expenses baked in.

https://testfol.io/?s=cVq8GTseCgR

During bear markets, the daily reset is protective of the funds from linear losses. A loss of 33% on 3x leverage margin is a 100% wipeout.

If it goes up 10% again on day 2, the 3x leverage puts you at 169.  When you have consecutive days of positive gains, the leverage also magnifies the compounded returns.

So, yes, when the market is sideways, the decay on a leveraged ETF can kill you.  But this leads some to erroneously conclude that this MUST mean that leverage ETFs will eventually go to zero due to the decay.

Yes, it is a ""cost"" that is essentially guaranteed to long run cost you, making you underperform pure 2x or 3x.

No, it will not make you decay to zero. Thats not how that works. The legal disclaimer is the same as ""warning: hot coffee is hot"". 

Beta slippage also works in your benefit, particularly in low volatility environments like right now. Low volatility regimes result in outperforming plain 2x or 3x because beta slippage (the general case of ""volatility decay"") compounds small gains upwards and results in gradual trimming of leverage as price drops resulting in less loss than pure 2x or 3x. The opposite of ""decay"".

But the short version is that if you bought before a crash like 2008, you might still be down today, or at least would be down over a long period of time. Backtests of these ETFs are very sensitive to when you enter/exit them. Move your test one year and suddenly you're under-performing SPY.

This is why there's a more complicated approach - the 'hedgefundie' approach (named after a commenter who helped spur discussion) uses UPRO and a leveraged bond fund.

ikkmr0h,"Preface: I’m long SSO (2x daily S&P 500). I effectively lumped in by reallocating my Roth IRA to 60% VOO, 40% SSO around early March, and have also experienced it with some DCA via my brokerage account, allowing me to have both experiences at once. 

Everybody wants to hold LETFs long term, until it’s time to hold LETFs long term. 

As with seemingly every aspect of equity investing, people tend to fixate on the sexy part— allocation. What they tend to ignore is that behaviors and psychology can be success killers. 

At one point this year, the SSO position in my Roth IRA was -30%. The market has been trending very steadily down, with the S&P 500 having… I think it was 5 straight red weeks at one point? Everything you hear about LETFs is “vol decay! Don’t hold when consistently down or sideways!” Again, that -30% position made up about 40% of my Roth IRA, and contribution cap meant I couldn’t DCA. 

Main point: the reality every day for months was waking up to a significant position going deeper into the red, faster than the index, knowing that this is specifically the worst set of market conditions for holding these assets. 

People were panic selling out of unlevered accounts and positions every day. Market news was doom and gloom. 

That’s uncomfortable, and my positions are only 2x, not 3x like UPRO, or 3x equities AND bonds as both sides crashed, like HFEA. For all I knew, the market could continue going down for another year or more. 

The question we all need to answer before we allow ourselves to find that circumstance is, “how realistic is it for me as an individual to hold through that type of extended down cycle? How will I feel about that?” Everybody wants to believe they’ll hold. The LETF sub pretty well dried up, so a lot of people seemed to feel less enthusiastic when things got real. 

Main point: you need to understand you, before you get into these. 

Frankly, I went 1.4x without a bond hedge because I took the time to learn about drag, circumstances which could bury both sides of hedged strategies at once, etc. I spent time doing nightmare scenario backtests. While doing so, I quickly realized that I wanted no part of relying on a hedge, or holding 3x leveraged equities. For me, the velocity of downturns in 3x is not agreeable. 

However, I was very comfortable and confident with 2x as part of an overall 1.4x, unhedged strategy. 

That careful consideration is why I’ve been able to hold. 

As I type this, that SSO position in my Roth IRA is still -8.66%, and there is a lot of talk of a reversal of the rally, and deeper lows to follow. Because I set the position on the way down, it has never been green. 

That’s OK for me. It may be OK for you. Maybe it wouldn’t be. You need to sort that out before you consider committing to these.

ikkcrzu,"Y'all are confusing yourselves with volatility decay and whatnot. Leverage exists in private markets (e.g. private equity firms almost always lever their investments) as well and many of the S&P500 constituents have debt (i.e. leverage) on their balance sheets to begin with. 

When leverage results in higher returns is super simple: if the cost of debt is lower than the unlevered return, then the levered return will be higher than the unlevered. Given that borrowing costs should in theory be lower than equity returns, a levered ETF in the long run should always outperform the unlevered (assuming reasonably low mgmt fees).

Still, most retail investors should avoid levered ETFs. Let's say that after analysing your personal risk tolerance you have determined that you can hold 50% of your wealth in the S&P500, and the remainder in cash. A 2x levered S&P500 would have double the volatility, so for the same risk tolerance, you should hold only 25% of your wealth in a 2x levered S&P500 ETF. 25% of your wealth in 2x levered S&P500 will produce a slightly lower return than 50% of wealth in the unlevered S&P500 due to borrowing costs, so you would be worse off.",1660680615,2,investing,wpvplv,/r/investing/comments/wpvplv/why_are_leveraged_etfs_like_upro_discouraged_for/ikkcrzu/

By the time you recover you will hit another drawdown and your PnL will asymptotically approach zero as a function of time and volatility. This is not as problematic if you have 10-20% leverage (it’s recoverable, but beyond a certain level of vol your odds of making money in the long run converge towards 0). In fact if you have a long horizon and are 100% invested in equities it would be a good strategy to deploy 10-20% leverage to magnify the returns over time.

ikm870u,"Stocks can crash a lot before circuit breakers kick in, and you need more upside to overcome it. I’m gonna pull some numbers out of my ass because I’m tired but let’s say that stocks crash 10%. If they rise 10% after that, you’re still in the red. You need them to rise 11-12% to be back to break even. You also need them to make that 11-12% rise -without- dropping again. If they rise 5% and then crash 10% again, you’re not looking for a 15% rise (0 - 10 + 5 -10) to get back to break even, you’re looking for closer to 20% to get back to break even because you’re still trying to recover the original crash + the second crash. 

Stocks do tend to rise, on average, over the long term. Yes. However because the downside hurts you more than the upside helps you, all those down days results in death by a thousand cuts as you very slowly bleed money from all the down days. 

Also remember that you’re very much over-exposed to the “black swan” days where the markets tank. A 10% drop in S&P is a 30% drop for you, and there won’t be a single day 10% rise back up, it’ll be very slow chipping away at the red rises. The worst day in modern US stock market history, from a brief search I just did, was March 9, 2020, where the S&P closed down just under 10%. These events can and do happen.

I did a quick analysis of 2 broad-market ETFs ([XUS.TO](https://XUS.TO) and [XEF.TO](https://XEF.TO)) over all of 2021 and they did OK.  I didn't pick these funds for any reason other than I had end-of-day data for the TSX handy and these are broad-market funds.

XUS was up 144 days, down 105 days, and sideways 12 days.  Overall it was up 26.13% without leverage, and if it were 3x leveraged it would have been up 92.79%, so a bit more than the 3x.

However, these are hypotheticals.  Since these AREN'T leveraged and there is no direct leveraged equivalent (i.e. that uses those funds as the underlying), it's hard to judge the actual outcome, and these are the best numbers you could hope for;  in practice leveraged funds have relatively high MERs to account for the rebalancing costs plus other inefficiencies.

The strategy is based on an approach called ""Lifecycle Investing""

https://www.lifecycleinvesting.net/

Here is a paper discussing more background: 
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1149340

The authors of the book discuss how to achieve the strategy with S&P LEAPS or with margin from your broker. 

All in all, I think the strategy is mostly sound, although asking young investors to be comfortable with more exotic financial instruments is tough. 

In any case, 3x is probably too much. If you really want to pursue this, try targeting leverage between 1.5x-2x.",1737222983,2,investing,1i49w8t,/r/investing/comments/1i49w8t/is_investing_a_third_of_your_money_on_3x_leverage/m7u4p2i/

I have substantially outperformed the index since that time, despite giving the index a running head start due to my timing. (Sidebar: I knew as everyone else did that rate hikes would send the market lower, and went in expecting to underperform during the down period and use rebalancing to rip on the recovery. It worked.) I was -23% in 2022, +38% in 2023, +37% last year, then tuned my leverage down from 1.4x to 1.1x (while holding a 30% cash position) a couple weeks ago.

The last one I read was a nonleveraged strategy, but one that rotates in and out of the SPY based on whether the closing price in the last day of the month was higher or lower than the 200 SMA (to reduce seesaws). That, too, has been shown to outperform a buy&hold for the periods tested. 

The last table in this paper is a bit anticlimactic though, as is the case usually with strategies that are publicised. They usually become public when they don't work as well as they used to anymore. The table shows that if you take a more recent period (2009-2020) rather than going all the way back to 1928, both the *SSO 200-d LRS* and the *UPRO 200-d LRS* have lower Sharpe/Sortino Ratios, higher drawdowns, higher volatilities and higher Betas than a buy&hold of the SP500 during the same period. In other words, the returns if you take a more recent (and arguably a more representative) period, came at the expense of assuming greater risk. The sad fact with any strategy that has the potential for outperformance is: the more people that know about it and use it, the less effective it becomes.",1637530695,78,investing,qz07zp,/r/investing/comments/qz07zp/how_to_3x_the_sp_cagr_with_less_risk_leverage_for/hlk70pm/

I think the hardest thing about this strategy is conviction through drawdowns although the author does mention that the benefit of momentum trading is that it naturally rotates the trader out of the position.

I wonder if this strategy could be applied to sector-based ETFs or even creating your own portfolio of momentum-based equity securities and leveraging with margin or derivatives. Also would be interested in the tail-risk of this strategy to see how we could hedge against it.

hlkoift,"> Everyone says that triple leveraged ETFs have volatility decay and are not meant for long-term holding. Well guess what, those people are idiots. The reason this works is because of the lack of volatility above the 200 MA, and higher volatility below the 200 MA.

I like leveraged ETFs but I'm going to push back on this. Leveraged ETF decay is real and does exist and saying those people are idiots just shows a lack of understanding of these complex instruments. The reason shown in the paper why you should sell when below the 200 MA is that with enough volatility, leveraged decay is in fact real and very very high, otherwise why even sell below the 200 MA? The paper also only used the leveraged S&P500, backtesting SSO and UPRO. Other leveraged ETFs that follow more volatile indices such as oil or biotech or semiconductors, might have a completely different result because of the higher volatility. So this backtest of SSO and UPRO looks pretty good, but you don't want to ignore things like leveraged decay in an analysis of leveraged ETFs and even more so for other non-S&P500 ETFs.",1637538319,7,investing,qz07zp,/r/investing/comments/qz07zp/how_to_3x_the_sp_cagr_with_less_risk_leverage_for/hlkoift/

hlm2apu,"Yes, regarding the first point. That's the point that I was trying to make. Now that cheap and accessible leverage is available, and faster executions and lower commissions are available, to the lay investor, strategies that outperformed using these variables before would now get squeezed out (because if you think about it: if everyone starts to lever above the 200 SMA and unlever below the 200 SMA, it will stop providing better returns with the same or lower risk.)

Regarding the second point, yes, people have different tolerances and different abilities to take risk. While the table shows that the LRS strategy had lower volatility and drawdown than just holding UPRO, it also had lower total returns and Sharpe Ratio. So the whole premise of the paper (achieving excess return while taking lower risk) did not hold for table 11 anymore, which looks at a more recent period (2009-2020).",1637564237,8,investing,qz07zp,/r/investing/comments/qz07zp/how_to_3x_the_sp_cagr_with_less_risk_leverage_for/hlm2apu/

If you had found a strategy that works with certainty, you'd be keeping it secret, not advertising it to the world. As someone else has said, these strategies become much more common when they're less likely to keep working. Why would you advertise a strategy to others if it indeed worked?

And if you backtested it using levered ETFs, you'd find that the 200SMA breaks down for leveraged products in the 1970s.

mi09o3v,"there are many many smart people who will give you every academic reason why you should not hold leverage ETF's.......

But you can also use your own two eye balls and look at the returns of the leverage ETF's and see that they have essentially blown away their underlying index.  

I'll say this as a word of caution.  They will do amazing if the market goes consistently up like over the last 10-15 years they will do badly if the market trades slowly down, or is very volatile to the downside. 

My advice is that you don't have to be 100% right with leveraged ETF's but you definitely can't be wrong with them.  You could miss 50% of a bull run and using a 3x leveraged ETF still come out better than holding the underlying, but it can be extremely painful if you fail to anticipate a downward swing correctly, like what we just had, TQQQ lost 31% in a month, my personal favorite FNGB is down 37% in a month, I got out towards middle of February b/c I thought march would be rough, which I'm glad I did.

While I am interested in this kind of funds too, I consider more as a way to buy the dip in a severely depressed market that is already 30-40-50% down than as something to consider near all time high valuations with indicator showing that stocks are expensive.

these tools or more advanced one based on leverage can also be a ways to cap your loss. Say you could be 25% invested in a 3X leveraged ETF and have otherwise 75% bond. You net exposure is 75% bond and 75% stocks.

Yes, the leveraged ETG itself experiences beta slippage (not volatility decay). When returns are low or mid while vol is high, volatility decay simply means that you make less than 3x the expected return. Beta slippage also compounds upwards.

2. 3X leverage is probably too much in the long term, although there is a chance it could work. Not worth the risk. 1.5X to 2X is adequate for a risk tolerant investor to hold long term.


3. For the hundredth time, no you do not. The drag can work in your favor. UPRO (3X SPY) has performed close to 5X SPY from inception in some time frames. If you don't want a leveraged ETF, you can also take a margin loan, but then you'd have to pay interest, and could get margin called, which is not ideal. Something like an unpaid mortgage with very low interest qualifies as a source of good leverage.


4. Again, leverage has time diversification benefits over an investor's lifetime. Young investors with a good risk tolerance and safe future earnings are making a sensible decision when they leverage a well diversified global equity portfolio.


5. By the way, there are ways to use leverage to keep your risk constant for higher amount of return, by leveraging a stock/bond portfolio (something like RSSB).

The fact that the unleveraged investment returned 0% whereas the leveraged investment returned -6,67% is due to the decay. Decay, along with large tail risk, are the biggest disadvantages of leveraged ETFs.

This explanation shows a misunderstanding of “daily releveraging”.  Anything that goes down 30% and up 33.33% the next day will result in a two-day 6.67% loss. It’s math. It has nothing to do with “daily releveraging”.",1615354157,2,investing,m1hspa,/r/investing/comments/m1hspa/a_case_for_leveraged_etfs/gqf0mmq/

gqfdnsv,"It does have something to do with leverage actually.

Sure, you could argue that a more volatile index or stock would suffer from the same problems. And that's partially true. But what mathematical decay refers to, is the fact that levered up daily returns will *always* cause decay relative to the underlying unlevered benchmark. This isn't true for just any high-beta stock or index. Why? High-beta stocks or indices are usually not perfectly correlated with well-diversified indices. In other words, the daily return of the MSCI IT doesn't equal 1,5 times the daily return of the MSCI USA just because the beta of the MSCI IT would be 1,5 (I mean, that isn't even how beta works but let's apply it like that). This is because the MSCI IT is not perfectly correlated with the MSCI USA.

In the end, higher volatility stocks don't even necessarily have a higher beta. When they have low correlations to the underlying index, their beta's could be lower than 1, even though they are way more volatile.

The decay thing should be seen as ""decay relative to the underlying unlevered index"". 

I get what you are trying to say though, but decay is a real thing. And even if decay applies to more volatile stocks in the same way that it does to leveraged, well-diversified indices, it's still a problem that also specifically relates to applying daily leverage.

h25hple,"For me the process of choosing LETFs is the same as the process of choosing normal ETFs, keeping in mind that the risks are higher, so I want to be 100% sure that the ETF will go up in the short/medium term. There's a bigger decay when holding LETFs during ""saw"" times (when the price often goes up & down), but usually that decay is easily covered by the higher profit from the increase in the LETF's price.

Currently, I have 1/3 of my investments in 3x ETFs, 1/3 in 2x ETFs, 1/3 in (normal ETFs & common stocks) & 1% in crypto.

My biggest LETF holdings are:

LABU, SOXL, PILL, BIB, TQQQ, DDM, SPUU, QLD, UPRO, UBOT, UDOW.

All except LABU have a positive unrealized gain currently.

With LABU I didn't expect what would happen. It was \~185 in January 2021. When it dropped to 133, I thought it was a good drop and invested in it, but then it dropped a lot more. To ""average out"" my unrealized loss I bought more LABU at low levels ($60-70) and now my situation with LABU is much better, but still -8%. I've used this ""averaging out"" multiple times and it works well. I'm not really worried about LABU, I'm 95% sure it will make me profit eventually.

I always hold my positions for at least a month, as this is a requirement of my employer :( I have access to all trades of my bank, so they think I theoretically may use this knowledge to my advantage.

I have about 70 positions and I haven't sold a single position at a loss. This is my principle, and so far it has always worked (I started investing not long ago though, in 2019).

Usually, I sell when I make at least 70% profit, sometimes 30%, sometimes I'm unlucky and I sell as soon as I get to a positive gain (when I want to get rid of a position that didn't do well), but this is rare, usually I make 2 digits profit.

Before 2021 my portfolio was making 38%/year, but I had a few bad investments in 2021 (LABU & IT/tech) and now the average profit of my portfolio is about 30%/year.

My biggest gain in % so far is RETL (3x retail), +316%. Too bad I didn't invest much in it.

Here's how I started and how I can recommend starting to someone who's never worked with LETFs:

At first, I invested $1000 in 4 LETFs and I quickly made a good profit (for example, made 100% with PILL in 1 month). That gave me more confidence and I invested again, that time more money. Made good profit again. Invested even more, etc.

Also, you can start with 2x ETFs, for example, SPUU (2x S&P) is a simple way to get \~20-30%/year. It's made 29.7% on average in the last 5 years. But it's very important to invest at the right time, at least if it's a serious amount, you should be careful and patient. For example, wait until the index (1x) drops by \~10% and invest in a 2x-3x version of that index.",1623974111,3,investing,m1hspa,/r/investing/comments/m1hspa/a_case_for_leveraged_etfs/h25hple/

When your stock drops x%, it has to gain more % to get even. You drop more, you will have to gain even more to break even.  That’s it. High risk and high reward holds true for any stock,leverage or not.

The results above take this into account. Even if starting with a lump-sum investment at literally the worst single day you could have picked over the past 40+ years, the 2x leveraged index would *never* show lower absolute returns than the unleveraged alternative over a 20-year investment horizon. For the 3x leveraged ETF, the chance of that happening would be 1,5%.

Also, some of the higher returns were +100 000% for the 3x leveraged index, but let us take a more conservative example. If the cumulative return would be 30 000%, € 1 would grow to € 301. A subsequent return of -95% would leave you with € 15,05, that's still a return of 1 405%. Due to right skewness and relatively long right tails, it is not unlikely to experience such (or better) results.

>Don’t forget a fee for rebalancing as a big drag on this performance + implicit costs for funding.

I mention costs in the OP as well. What matters is that the leveraged ETF accurately tracks its benchmark. As long as that's the case, costs will not matter too much (unless of course they are disproportionately high, which probably won't happen given the competitiveness and cost awareness out there).

>The returns are annualized I meant to ask you -are the returns compounded on a daily basis? Ie today you earn 10% tomorrow the same 10% actually earns you 11% of your original principal.

gqfwbb0,">TQQQ is there time riskier than QQQ. High risk high reward. This is not about daily rebalancing.

That's not true. If you borrow € 200 and invest a total of € 300 into an ETF (€ 100 equity and € 200 debt), **there is no decay**. By borrowing this way and investing in ""the market portfolio"", you would increase your beta from 1 to 3. Hence, the daily, weekly, monthly, annual, etc. market (risk) premium will be multiplied by 3. Try this in Excel and you will see. But this is not how leveraged ETFs work.

I'll try to explain it more thoroughly:

Under the CAPM, theoretically speaking, investors would borrow at the risk-free rate to increase their beta. This is the most simple way of leverage. In this case, if beta increases from 1 to 2, you would earn the risk-free rate plus two times the market premium. Hence, 2x leverage this way would double excess returns (i.e., the market premium). It would double daily excess returns, monthly, annually, etc. Whatever the market premium for the unleveraged portfolio is, the 2x leveraged portfolio would earn twice that market premium. **There is no decay here**.

Now, since investors can neither borrow money in such a simple way, nor borrow at the risk-free rate, this simple method of attaining leverage isn't available. That's why I looked into leveraged ETFs in the first place. But these leveraged ETFs simply seek exposure to daily returns. Hence, the daily return on a 2x leveraged ETF will be twice the daily return of the underlying index. But this does not imply that weekly, monthly, annual, etc. returns for the 2x leveraged ETF will also be twice as high. **That's due to the decay, which is present in this case.**

So to come back to your statement, decay isn't always there when you leverage up or increase beta. Decay is only there for specific types of leverage, like daily re-leveraging.",1615381536,8,investing,m1hspa,/r/investing/comments/m1hspa/a_case_for_leveraged_etfs/gqfwbb0/

That said, I still think that you improperly explain what a leverage ETF is.

Daily 3x performance of a triple leverage ETF does not imply a 3x long-term performance.  This is what you explained. This needs to be explained to new investors.

What is improper is to call this ""decay"".  What is improper is the failure to explain this behavior in a one-sided and negative way.

Like yours, many improper explanation of TQQQ points out that if QQQ gains 10% and loses 10% the next day,  TQQQ will lose 3 times more than QQQ does in those two days.

What is improper is the failure to point out that if QQQ gains 10% and another 10% the next day, TQQQ will gain more than 3 times QQQ does in those two days.

gqhlsqq,"Hey, I’m genuinely curious what is wrong. In my eyes, the line of thinking that buying leveraged funds when the market is down because you’re expecting a rebound is wrong, as a rebound isn’t what drives the leveraged fund profits. Low enough volatility through the rebound is (that might be a great bet, but it’s a very different one). While TQQQ might hold some equities to lower their costs, the fundamental risk of losing principal is the same. If TQQQ goes down one day, your total leveraged exposure will from that point be lower than if you hadn’t held TQQQ that day. These leveraged funds only resemble 3x the capital during the day, holding for multiple days is making a very different bet (possibly still a great one) on the market than holding stocks.

I say all of this as somebody who incorporates leveraged funds into their portfolio. If there’s some large misunderstanding, I’d really like to know.

If the nasdaq grows over a decade, I know QQQ will be worth more than it was at the start of the decade. The price of TQQQ is based on what happened during the decade. While it is probable it increased in value, it’s also possible that it hasn’t or has gone down when viewed at the end of the decade.

gqg2qxw,">""Decay"" is a semantically inaccurate description of amplification of daily leverage because it is a one-sided negative description.

Good point.

Well, there's good sides to decay as well. For example, due to the daily re-leveraging, leverage (in relation to the initial investment) increases as prices rise and leverage decreases as prices drop. Hence, decay actually causes some kind of defense mechanism. It has its pros and cons.

I understand your argument that decay is often used as shitty argument to discredit leveraged ETFs. The term ""decay"" just has a negative tone to it. Many new investors still seem to think that a 3x leveraged ETF grants you 3x total annual returns though, so explaining decay is still important.

The main disadvantage in comparison to just literally borrowing money to invest, is that leveraged ETFs can lose money in oscillating markets even though the underlying unleveraged index returns 0%. And that is a big con of such ETFs, which is explained by decay. And in that context I even think the word ""decay"" is appropriate.

But as you say, it's true that leveraged ETFs shouldn't be ignored as long term investments simply due to decay. And it's true that this sadly still happens a lot due to fearmongering by so-called ""experts"". Decay doesn't imply that daily re-leveraging cannot make you lots of money, even if you just buy and hold. And I definitely disagree with people that say leveraged ETFs are only short-term trading instruments.",1615385208,6,investing,m1hspa,/r/investing/comments/m1hspa/a_case_for_leveraged_etfs/gqg2qxw/

Weirdly enough, the formula I listed at the bottom of my comment above still didn’t 100% match the actual TQQQ from 2010 to today. It actually underperforms it—usually like 98-99% of what TQQQ is actually achieving. Because this theoretical ETF underperformed consistently by 1-2%, I did not account for fees.  

Without adding a .0038% fee per day (0.95% expense ratio / 250 trading days in a year) I’m still underperforming the actual TQQQ, so I’m simply going with my formula above to account for the fees there. I figure if I can replicate TQQQ but underperform it by 1-2%/yr, then the fees would just about perfectly take into account that 1-2% per year.  

TLDR; if there was an actual TQQQ or UPRO or SPXL that existed in the past 50-100 years, it would have yielded my results within + or - .5% each year.

Another thing is , no one would ever hold a 3X ETF till it literally goes to zero, even if such an event happens.

So the gains from 3X etf are almost always more than mathematical analysis.

One might say, how do you know when there is a fundamental problem ? The answer to that is , once it's public you can sell then.

Suppose we keep having another bull run and TQQQ goes 10x again for 5 years. Then I might reallocate from 10% TQQQ to 5% TQQQ. Then of course, if we do experience massive drops, you’re not losing all your portfolio in one bad bear market, and still either have cash or other assets that could be sold to go more % TQQQ.  

I see myself potentially even selling other less risky bets like SPY and QQQ when the market is down to reallocate to TQQQ because the run-up will be so much greater.  

All of this is with the confidence that we won’t have another dotcom bubble or recession for a while. While I want to stay invested long-term 20+ years, if my investments 100x from 2020 to 2030 (as TQQQ did from 2010 to 2020), I’m quite certain I’m going to call it a day and sell out and retire early at that point.

gqffw8f,">Modern portfolio theory is getting blown out of the water.

I disagree. Leveraging up makes sense according to the CAPM, for example. (Yes I know, the CAPM isn't the same as Markowitz's initial idea, but it started there). Theoretically, you would look for the portfolio with the best risk-adjusted return and then lever up to attain a required level of exposure to systematic risk (beta). 

Hedgefundies' Excellent Adventure on the Bogleheads forum, which you referred me to (thanks btw, great read) uses this approach to a certain degree. He created a portfolio with higer risk-adjusted returns that the S&P 500 alone by using risk parity and creating a portfolio with treasury bonds in it as well. Then he levered up to gain more systematic exposure (i.e., he increased beta). Of course a risk parity approach is different from a mean variance approach, and the biggest issue with Hedgefundie's portfolio (imo) is that it ignores expected returns. The portfolio may not be optimal in a future where we do not see a long-term trend of decreasing interest rates. But I'm getting off topic.

I don't think crypto's are a good argument against MPT either. At least I don't see why. If you mean that it's a good argument against the Efficient Market Hypothesis, I get that. But I still don't think that it disproves EMH (or MPT).

gqj4jjq,"> Yes, and I acknowledged that in the very sentence you are quoting. Still, you're not going to get even remotely close to a 13.4% differential between the two. Again, at 40% overlap that is mathematically improbable.

You're pulling that out of your ass that it's mathematically improbable. If tech sees EPS's inflate further and further then I would argue that QQQ dropping 33% in response to SPY dropping 20% would be *likely*, not just possible. Think about how QQQ got hurt worse in March than SPY even though the Nasdaq-100 companies were the ones that weren't negatively impacted by the shutdown. The 61% of QQQ that is not a part of SPY (after weighting) is much more prone to forming a bubble, and can be much more negatively impacted by a crash depending on the circumstances. 

> The article you're quoting from is not exactly impartial to LETFs nor does it take into account real-world scenarios. In theory yes, the LETF should dissolve, but reality is often not so black and white. The argument that I am making has nothing to do with what ought to happen in theory.

It **has to** dissolve. Hell, it will probably be liquidated even if it doesn't lose 100% of it's value. I looked it up and they liquidated XIV after it lost 80% in a single day, not 100. I'm sure even you can admit that if SPY drops 20% in a single day, QQQ could easily end up dropping 27% on that same day.

Also do you have an article that states otherwise?

> XIV held derivates of the VIX, which in itself is a derivative. Not quite the same thing as TQQQ. 66% of TQQQ is stock of NASDAQ-100 companies held directly. Even if QQQ drops 33.4%, that portion of TQQQ will always have a value >$0.

Irrelevant. What we're talking about is % movement of the underlying. You realize this so don't be pedantic.

If an ETF goes from $100 to $95 (down 5%), then the 3x leveraged version of that ETF would go down 15% (from $100 to $85). Now if the unleveraged ETF goes back to $100 from $95 (up 5.26%), then the leveraged ETF would go up 3 x 5.26 = 15.79%, which would go from $85 to $98.42. This means that you lost 1.68% in 2 days even though the underlying was flat over those 2 days. In the long run, this can be detrimental, especially in extended downturns. However, if the underlying ETF can perform well enough without excessive volatility, the leveraged ETFs will perform extremely well.

mh28o10,"Leveraged ETFs don’t track their indices perfectly for a few reasons:

	1. Daily Rebalancing – They aim for a multiple (2x, 3x, etc.) of daily returns, not long-term performance. Because they rebalance daily, compounding effects can cause big deviations over time, especially in volatile markets.

	2. Volatility Decay – In choppy markets, gains and losses compound in a way that creates “volatility drag,” often making the ETF underperform its target multiple over time.

	3. Transaction Costs & Fees – These funds rely on derivatives like futures and swaps, which come with higher trading costs and management fees compared to regular index ETFs.

	4. Tracking Error – Differences in timing, cash holdings, and fund structure can cause returns to stray from the index they’re supposed to track.

That said, recency bias has made a lot of people think holding leveraged ETFs long-term works out fine because markets have mostly gone up. In a prolonged recession, though, the compounding losses can absolutely destroy your investment.

mh2au5g,"These leveraged funds aren't designed to be held long term, they are almost always used to amplify the % DAILY performance of a security. Most of these funds are ""reset"" at the end of each trading day. They use things like options and futures contracts to approximate a 2x/3x of the daily % change of the security it is trying to amplify. This means when you hold long term you have to deal with compounding gains/losses. Because they only track the % DAILY performance of the underlying, over time the price of the leveraged ETF will decay due to compounding gains/losses. So if SPX goes down 1% a day for five days straight, it will only be down 4.9%. In the same time, SPXL will go down 14.1%. To recover to the same level, SPX will only need to go up 5.1%, while SPXL will need to go up 16.4%.

There are very high fees involved with these types of funds since they involve complicated derivative products and daily restructuring. This also eats away at the gains over longer periods.

kecl73f,">somebody tell me why i’m wrong. there has to be a reason more people dont pile into TQQQ but do pile into QQQ to hold for longterm. is it just risk appetite and they dont want to deal with 3x downturns? im 23 so i still have plenty of time to be able to afford high risk so i would be okay with 3x downturns assuming im not missing something big here.

You're not wrong, you've found a strategy that makes people who go long-term long millionaires very quickly. TQQQ is up 11,000% since 2010. Buying and holding LETFs has ridiculous returns due to how the daily rebalancing mechanisms compound exponential growth (far beyond just 3x the base ticker) and the fact that nearly all market growth happens in extended trading.

keaapjj,"I'm someone who is close in age to you and invests heavily in $TQQQ.

While I do recognize that volatility decay is a thing that will eat away at your returns, I think the critics fail to realize that it really isn't as bad as they are making it out to be. You do *not* need the NASDAQ to go on a massive multi-year bull run in order to make more money with $TQQQ.

Based on my rudimentary analysis, in any given year, with average volatility (<20 on $VXN, which tracks the volatility of the NASDAQ-100), if the NASDAQ-100 ($QQQ) …

… returns ~4% or less, you will lose money on $TQQQ, potentially a lot of money (see 2018).

… returns between ~4% and ~7%, you will make money on $TQQQ but have a lower return than if you just held $QQQ, and with significantly more risk.

… returns ~7% or more, you will make money on $TQQQ but less than 3x the return on the $QQQ.

… returns ~20% or more, you will make money on $TQQQ and more than 3x the return on the $QQQ.

So you need to ask yourself whether you think $QQQ will continue to return 7% or more nominally with average volatility. Given that the long-term average return for the S&P500 is about 10% nominally and the NASDAQ consistently outperforms the S&P500 (at the expense of increased volatility), I think it is a very solid investment hypothesis. The most realistic scenario I think going forward is what we have experienced in the past 5 years; $TQQQ outperforms $QQQ on a nominal basis, but not 3x, i.e. somewhere between a 7% and 20% annual return on $QQQ. 

Now if we get these huge volatility spikes that typically accompany a sudden downturn in the stock market like the ones in 2020 and 2022, you will lose a lot of money on $TQQQ temporarily which is why you need some hedge to be able to rebalance your portfolio with and buy more $TQQQ in those times of peril for pennies on the dollar. Then you ride the wave back up with your increased shares. How you go about hedging and rebalancing is up to you, but I would recommend checking out Hedgefundie and using $TMF (leveraged long-term treasuries). Did not work out well in 2022 unfortunately but that was because the hedge does not work against rising interest rates which hurt stocks and bonds simultaneously. Most other sudden drops in the stock market will cause bonds to rise in price to mitigate your overall portfolio losses and allow you to rebalance into $TQQQ cheaply. The great thing is that recently, every steep drop in $QQQ has been followed by a year in which $TQQQ returns more than 3x $QQQ (2019, 2021, 2023). This also helps to close the gap between when $QQQ and $TQQQ hit new all time highs after a downturn. 

Overall I simply think it's too good of an opportunity to pass up if you're young and don't have any other viable options to make significant amounts of money. If it works you become a multi-millionaire way quicker than you would with $QQQ and if it doesn't then it probably means that the returns on $QQQ were so poor that you probably weren't hitting your investment/retirement goals anyways. The window where investing in $QQQ over $TQQQ would have gotten you meaningfully closer to your objectives is quite small, so I say just go for it with $TQQQ and see what happens.",1703135296,18,investing,18n4fqh,/r/investing/comments/18n4fqh/investing_in_qqq_vs_tqqq_for_the_longterm/keaapjj/

It aims for three times return, it doesn’t always hit it. Not only do you get exposed to the negatives but on an annualized basis, you can end up dramatically worse. QQQ is down 2% on the year, TQQQ more than 17%. TQQQ is more accurate in matching QQQ on a day-to-day basis and that has consequences

mupgp1y,">even if it lost 50% because its leveraged it will still recover just as fast as the qqq no?

after a 20% loss you need a 200% gain to just break even. 

here's a 1999 to 2018 chart of QQQ with 3x leverage to show how devastating a major crash can be. https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/8/31/saupload_tqqq5.png",1748443130,1,investing,1kwhe6l,/r/investing/comments/1kwhe6l/tqqq_vs_qqq_confused_about_why_not_to_pick_tqqq/mupgp1y/
mur0uxe,"It only matches 3x daily returns, not overall returns.

If QQQ goes down 30% and up 50% on the next day, TQQQ will go down 90% and up 150% on the next day.

Or if we imagine you invested $100 in each:

QQQ goes from $100 -> $70 -> $105

TQQQ goes from $100 -> $10 -> $25

As you can see, it doesn't match overall gains and the ability to recover from drops isn't linear. A 50% drop requires 100% to recover. A 100% drop requires infinity% to recover. You can't compare a 1% drop to a 1% gain in the long run. It just gets worse as you multiply the drops by bigger and bigger numbers.

Imagine for a day QQQ drops by 34%. How long to recover from the drop on TQQQ? Forever. Meanwhile QQQ recovers in less than infinite time. Plus, drops tend to be massive when they happen to something like QQQ.

Although that's just an example to show what it trends towards. Pretty sure most letfs have some sort of stop loss or restriction that activates if they drop too much in a given day. It's not likely to actually hit 0 like that.

Honestly the way I see it, long term TQQQ is what i think your performance would be if you were on margin loan and margin called yourself on every day you ended with a loss, and sold shares at the bottom from it. You would constantly cripple your ability to recover, in the same way the letf does.",1748459273,1,investing,1kwhe6l,/r/investing/comments/1kwhe6l/tqqq_vs_qqq_confused_about_why_not_to_pick_tqqq/mur0uxe/

Another way you can lose money is by heavy down days. The most extreme example would be that it only takes a 33% down day to lose all your money. While very unlikely heavy panic days can cost you a ton of money over the long run.

g3zvduo,"I'm really late to this, so probably most of the people that need to see it won't....but it HAS been back tested into the worst case scenario (through the 2009 crash, before the current bull run). The research shows the ""common knowledge"" is wrong in this real world scenario. [http://ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php](http://ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php)  All the hypothetical scenarios used to say why it can't work (such as a ideally flat market of up 1% down 1%) while technically true, ignore the realities of the market...which is there are more up days than down days. After all, if this wasn't true, why invest at all since we'd all be losing money in a 1x fund, too. These arguments also ignore the compounding of positive days. If you get three positive days in a row, you don't just have 3X, you have a compounded 3X. 

All this doesn't mean it is a good investment for everyone. It is a terrible idea if you have a limited time horizon. After all, it can a long time to recover from a severe market crash. At the very least you'll want a 10 year runway...maybe even considerable more to be ""safe"". It also ignores investor behavior. If you can't stomach the added volatility, it isn't for you. And while it is technically impossible for it to go to 0, there are some scenarios where the fund could cease to exist for one reason or another at the worst possible time.

Then in a price correction, FAANG loses 2 or 3 months of gains (40%+) in one day, but the broader market only loses like 10-15%, triggering only a single circuit breaker stop, giving you one chance to cash out - but you don't take it.

Towards the end of the day, QQQ loses 33% of it's value in a single day bubble pop. TQQQ is set to lose 100% and become worthless.

Before it actually zeroes out, they halt trading on the ticker. You can't get out. There is a single news release stating that trading has been halted. No further explanation.

Hours later, another news release comes out. They announce that the NAV of the actual assets underlying TQQQ are worth penneys on the dollar. They announce a reverse stock split. The next day everyone's TQQQ shares are consolidated 10:1.

Game over.

This above trading halt and stock split scenario has played out on SEVERAL other leveraged ETFs. That's why they are dangerous as hell",1599237418,0,investing,im6q5p,/r/investing/comments/im6q5p/if_you_invested_10k_in_tqqq_10_years_ago_it_would/g407avr/
g3zvsn9,See my comment on this here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/im6q5p/_/g3zv2r5,1599233451,1,investing,im6q5p,/r/investing/comments/im6q5p/if_you_invested_10k_in_tqqq_10_years_ago_it_would/g3zvsn9/
g3zv2r5,"The portfolio of TQQQ essentially looks like this:

300% QQQ
-200% CASH

The ""-200% CASH"" represents a loan at the risk-free rate (usually three-month T-bills). It is negative because a loan essentially means that you are shorting three-month T-bills.

Now, the actual TQQQ resets leverage daily. Let's say you have $15,000 in TQQQ on a day where QQQ rises by 5%, then TQQQ's portfolio will look like this:

$15,750 QQQ
($10,000) CASH

However, the ratios are now off compared to the beginning. The portfolio is no longer 3x leveraged. It is now 15750  / (15750 - 10000) = 2.74x leveraged. So at the end of the trading day, TQQQ rebalances its portfolio to keep the 3x ratio. In this case, that would result in this portfolio:

$15,750 QQQ
($10,500) CASH

This is the new baseline for TQQQ, and what it will be the next day of trading. Basically, every time TQQQ gains, it increases its risk the next day by taking on more loans and every time it loses, it decreases its risk by reducing its loans. This is done to keep the 3x ratio.

In my backtest, the simulated TQQQ does what I described above monthly rather than daily because PortfolioVisualizer only has monthly data. Depending on the stock, this could have better or worse results. In the case of TQQQ, it actually does better than the actual TQQQ, so your money would be worth even less than in that backtest had you invested the money 20 years ago.",1599233205,1,investing,im6q5p,/r/investing/comments/im6q5p/if_you_invested_10k_in_tqqq_10_years_ago_it_would/g3zv2r5/

g40b22e,"To be honest, leveraged equities ARE difficult to understand and, for the most part, I would not recommend using them even if you did understand them well. My one exception to using leverage is when it's done in a balanced portfolio like [HEDGEFUNDIE's Excellent Adventure](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=272007). Even then, it's still a very risky play, but a much smarter one than straight TQQQ.

You might be ok riding a paper loss but it is very easy to underperform what you're leveraging in a volatile market when leverage resets daily.

See this example:

You own $100 of QQQ and $100 of TQQQ.

QQQ drops 5% (this happened yesterday). You now have $95 in QQQ.

Therefore, TQQQ drops 15%. You now have $85 in TQQQ.

The next day, QQQ gains 5%. You now have $99.75 in QQQ.

Therefore, TQQQ gains 15%. You now have $97.75 in TQQQ.

Despite being only 3x leveraged, you have lost 9x what QQQ lost. That is due to the daily resets. If this continues to happen, the difference will compound and it becomes quite hard to recover from.

In my opinion, you should stick to a [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio). You can do this with 100% equities by just buying VT.",1599238730,2,investing,im6q5p,/r/investing/comments/im6q5p/if_you_invested_10k_in_tqqq_10_years_ago_it_would/g40b22e/

3x leveraged ETFs face a high closure rate due to inherent risks like volatility drag and potential mandatory redemptions. The regulatory environment is also becoming more restrictive, further impacting the viability of these products. Therefore, investors should exercise extreme caution when considering 3x ETFs and are generally advised against using them for long-term investing. ",1754792432,3,investing,1mm67il,/r/investing/comments/1mm67il/which_one_is_better_tqqq_200_sma_strategy_vs_qld/n7vk2gp/

lkdk61i,"TQQQ doesn’t have enough price history to give you an idea of how it would perform if the overall market falls say 50%.

You can do it with a backtest tough. I tried that with a hypothetical 3xS&P500 ETF starting in 2007 once. At the bottom in march 2009, you would be down like 95%. The 3x etf would breakeven with the 1x around 2018, only to get beaten back down in 2020.

Today, after 17 years, the 3x ETF would only be ~25% higher than the regular index. Thats a lot of volatility for a pretty modest gain if you as me.

Of course, you could do better by continously buying throughout the period. But even then, 10 or even 20 years may not be enough if the market gets an extended period of poor returns.

dlub070,"So a few reasons I will list the simple reason first

1. Fees at 1% the fee is high

2. Risk. If the market goes down it loses 3X the value. At 3X leverage what happens when the market drops 34% ? Granted it never happened in one day but in 2008 the market lost over 50% in a month.

3. Beta-Slippage this is actually the real reason. So remember a 3X ETF will out preform the market gains/losses 3x in one day. The 3x only is for one day only, not a week not a month. One day only .

Ok so for easy math lets say the s&P index is at 1,000

Lets say you have a perfectly 3x leveraged ETF and a perfect non-leveraged ETF both priced at 1000 for easy math and you own one share.

Ok day 1 market goes up 2.5%

Non-leveraged up 2.5%  1000+(1000*2.5%) =1025
You made $25

Leveraged up 7.5% 1000+(1000*7.5) = 1075
you just made $75


Day 2 Market drops back down to 1000. It would really drop (2.439%) to get back to 1000

Non-leveraged 1025-(25)=1000
well you lost 25$ but really even at the tend of the day

leveraged (I will show the actual math)

1075 - (1075*(2.439% * 3))

1075 - (1075*(7.317%))

1075-78.66

996.34


So what happened? The SnP gained 25 points then dropped 25 points and the SnP is even, if you had invested in a S&P index you would be even too.

Well its just math. 3x EFT return those results per day, its a daily percent.
So what happens in a flat market where daily it goes up one day, down the next,up, down but at the end of the month its pretty much flat.

Well with a Regular index fund you are flat

With a 3X index fund you just lost money, sure they are great when the market steadily goes up, but they will fall apart very quickly in a flat market

dluhh4l,">but are there other reasons to not use leveraged etf of the S&P long term? 30 years for example.

Using daily returns starting from 1990 and ignoring any fees, $1000 invested in SPY would have turned to $6743.4. $1000 invested in UPRO would now have turned to $22344.4. CAGR for SPY would now stand at 7.1%, for UPRO at 12%.

But it's worth mentioning that the investmet in UPRO would have peaked in value around 2000 when it almost reached $40k with SPY still under 5k. It almost gets to SPY's level after that bear market and starts gaining again on the way to 2008.

In 2008-09 SPY actually gets ahead for a bit. SPY's minimum worth is $1880, UPRO's worth drops below the original investment, at $939.

At that point comes a new bull market leading to the UPRO investment tripling in worth relative to SPY, presumably so they can meet again whenever the next bear market comes.


In the long term and ignoring any fees, the leveraged etf seems to be doing about as well if we're currently in a bear market and much better if we're in a bull market. It's also a rollercoaster, so someone seeing it drop like stone might sell it and then miss the bounce.

Looking at this, it's something you don't need to be afraid to hold for quite a while but unless you love risk, you don't gain anything by holding it for 30 years.

dlv2fv8,"I see leveraged decay mention any time leveraged ETFs are brought up, but I disagree.

On any two consecutive days, there are only 4 possible combinations of stock movement: 

1. Stock price increases on Day 1. Stock price increases on Day 2.
2. Stock price increases on Day 1. Stock price decreases on Day 2.
3. Stock price decreases on Day 1. Stock price increases on Day 2
4. Stock price decreases on Day 1. Stock price decreases on Day 2.

^(I suppose it is possible that a stock closes with exactly 0% movement, but that's irrelevant because there couldn't possibly be any ""decay"" if the stock doesn't move, so I'm going to ignore that)

Everyone will focus on Scenarios 2-4 in their examples, and it is true your expected return given any of these circumstances is worse than an unleveraged ETF. However, the returns for Scenario 1 will exactly cancel out any losses for the other three scenarios combined.

As an example, pretend that in our four scenarios that the stock either goes up 10% each day, or it goes down 10%. 

With an unleveraged fund, your expected return is:

1. $121
2. $99
3. $99
4. $81

The average of these four scenarios is exactly $100 and the expected return is exactly 0%.

With a 3x leveraged fund, your expected return in each scenario is:

1. $169
2. $91
3. $91
4. $49

Just like the unleveraged fund, the average ending balance is $100, for a return of exactly 0%. So while the actual gains in Scenarios 2-4 in the 3x leveraged fund were worse than the unleveraged, the gains in Scenario 1 directly offset them.

dlv37ml,"Pet peeve (nothing against you): People who explain this calculation never seem to mention what happens if there are two up days or two down days in a row... (to be fair, you hinted at it at the end)

Two up days:

Non-leveraged: $1000 * 102.5% * 102.5% ≈ $1050.6 ($50.6 win)

Leveraged: $1000 * 107.5% * 107.5% ≈ $1155.6 ($155.6 win)

$155.6 **>** 3 * $50.6 = $151.8

Two down days (down ≈ 2.44%, as in your example):

Non-leveraged: $1000 * 97.56% * 97.56% ≈ $951.8 ($48.2 loss)

Leveraged: $1000 * 92.68% * 92.68% ≈ $859 ($141 loss)

$141 **<** 3 * $48.2 = $144.6


There's no free Anti-Lunch in an efficient market. Ignoring transactions costs, in a market where it is possible to take either side of a trade, it should be just as hard to reliably destroy money as it is to make it.

dlvx9ua,"Keep in mind that the numbers you are using are massive swings that no investor would tolerate long term and thus would not persist in the market.  A market that goes up 2.5% one day and down 7.5% the next day is a market in the midst of a horrible bear market.  That suggests a VIX in the high double digits, if not over 100.  That's an untenable and therefore unrealistic scenario.

In a flat market (e.g. 2011, 2015) SSO and UPRO did just fine.  Yes, they were down a bit, but they hardly ""fell apart"".  Flat markets are generally calm markets so the volatility doesn't eat away at the price as fast you might think.  By marrying up the notion of an **extremely** volatile market with flat returns you have painted a scenario that isn't at all realistic.  

Besides, if we are investing for the long term, we should not be concerned with the gyrations of a few months or even a couple years.

dlx7dkj,"Daily re-balancing funds are constantly reducing leverage during falls.  Just because the market dropped 38% over some time period doesn't mean the fund dropped exactly 3x that much.  It depends on the sequence of up and down days. 

A simulated 3x daily SPX fund started in 1986 would've hit its peak in July of 2007 at $53.79.  It would've bottomed out in march at $2.74, for a loss of 95%.  This seems terrible, but note that the S&P was down 55% during that same time frame, so our theoretical losses should have been 165%.  Note that this would've been the case had we been 3x leveraged in a traditional way (margin, futures, etc).  Sequence of returns and daily re-balancing to achieve constant 3x leverage prevent the losses from being as severe as they could be. 

Still, I won't pretend 95% isn't a horrible drawdown.  Drawdowns like this can be avoided by avoiding using only a 3x leverage fund, as 3x is a bit greater than the optimal historical leverage -which is somewhere in the 2.xx range.  Assuming you don't put ALL of your holdings into UPRO, you could very well re-balance between SPY and UPRO/SSO so achieve desired leverage, which should be closer to 2x for younger investors with long investment time horizons.

I'm talking about what the prospectuses for funds like SSO, UPRO, SDYL, etc say.  I invest in these funds fairly heavily so I've read them thoroughly.  These funds have language about their termination thresholds and when they will terminate the funds.  You are suggesting there is some arbitrary ""fuck it, we're closing"" threshold, when I'm saying that these funds have explicit thresholds at which they will close down - none of which will ever happen to *daily* reset funds because of market circuit breakers.  

Conversely, a monthly fund like SDYL *might* get shut down because the prospectus says it may terminate in the event of a 60% intra-month draw down.  It's not impossible to conceive of the S&P losing 30% in a month. Thus, SDYL, a monthly reset fund, could be shut down due to the structure of the ETN.

http://ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php

There are two things one needs to make clear for himself.
1) Every financial product has a leverage which is completely arbitrary. The SPY or QQQ you regularly buy and hold also has a leverage of exactly 1. From an abstract standpoint we have to realize that leverage is something implicit in every financial product, even if it’s just 1. There are even ETFs with a leverage of 0.5. What that will do is they minimize the drawbacks of what other people criticize regarding LETFs even in comparison to the regular SPY. So e.g. a 0,5x LETF of SPY doesn’t have as much decay as the regular (1x) SPY on down-days.
BUT: You miss out on returns on the up-days. Obviously. 
What I want to say is that leverage is in every financial product and the leverage of 1x is basically arbitrary. 

2) That leads to the second point: there is no evidence that a leverage of exactly 1 is the perfect maximum risk/return leverage. It’s quite the opposite. If one thinks logical: why would a leverage of 1 be the exact, perfect r/r leverage. The link above has backtested it for SPY and QQQ.",1710052965,18,investing,1bb34i2,/r/investing/comments/1bb34i2/letfs_are_they_really_so_bad/ku6sebd/

However. Like others have commented, in the long term they lose out to QQQ because of inter-day volatility. LETFs can and do outperform indexes across short time frames in bull markets. Since my hypothesis is that we will have another few run ups this year, I’m staying in to capitalize on those gains. 

But it’s a short term gamble and I **HAVE** to profit-take at some point. Because it **WILL** drop below QQQ and start underperforming.

l8s854s,"> What are the disadvantages of investing in TQQQ instead of QQQ

The disadvantages are higher management fees than QQQ.

Higher volatility decay than QQQ

borrowing costs eating into the NAV

larger potential for behavioral issues from investors due to leverage

> If you’re expecting QQQ to be higher in 20 years compared to right now, doesn’t it make more sense to invest in TQQQ instead?

not necessarily, no. if you know what the standard deviation of QQQ will be over the next 20 years, what the returns of QQQ will be, and what the interest rates will average then you can determine if it would be a good deal or not. Those three items, along with the expense ratio of the funds determine your return on TQQQ. If any of those are particularly high during your investment period, you'll have poorer returns compared to, what you might expect given the leveraged ratio and even compared to the underlying fund.

I found this link from /u/modern_football on exactly this. I would encourage you to thoroughly read pretty much all of this man's threads on the topic as they are very good. I'd also encourage you to read the prospectus of the fund too and pay particular attention to the volatility vs returns table in the prospectus. 

From my own personal experience running a leveraged portfolio using TMF/TQQQ/UPRO (pretty much HEFA) I would have been better off sticking with the underlying - as I've only made 14% in total since June of 2020, in large part due to TMF but I knew that was a risk. However, this means I've lost about 34%+ in total returns as a result of using this portfolio and keeping with it compared to simply buying VOO.

jtit70a,"You'll want to check out /r/LETFs for strategies and backtests as most of the investing subreddits are completely ignorant about leveraged instruments and will just screech FUD at you. I've been buying into TQQQ through the 2022 crash and it's performing magnificently, if we go on another 10 year bull run with AI it's going to perform life-changingly well. In backtests 2-3x daily leverage is a sweet spot for long-term returns vs risk.

>If QQQ appreciates by 50% within a given timeframe, can I expect a 150% (or even 125%) return on TQQQ?

You can expect significantly higher returns during bull runs as TQQQ compounds 3x daily on itself. QQQ is up about 950% since 2010 and TQQQ is up 10000%. Even with the expense ratio and borrowing fees I see it actually outperform 3x QQQ's percentage movement on most days. In an optimistic case TQQQ will vastly outperform raw 3x leverage on a buy-in unless you're rebalancing daily. This makes it quite the high performing long-term hold if you can avoid being liquidated by black swans.

>My optimism towards technology and QQQ's long-term returns prompts me to question the potential hidden costs associated with TQQQ.

The costs are volatility drag during significant downturns, which have happened in 2020 and 2022, and the potential for the expense ratio + borrowing fee to add up if the ETF trades completely flat for an extended period of time, which is unprecedented for NASDAQ. Since NASDAQ is generally on an uptrend the costs are more than absorbed by the 3x daily compounding nature.",1690379341,5,investing,15a3dkr,/r/investing/comments/15a3dkr/very_longterm_investing_qqq_or_tqqq/jtit70a/

If you had bought TQQQ late last year or early this year, you would be up A TON. A far better return than anything else you might have imagined doing. 

Does it require high risk tolerance? Yes. 

Is there risk to it? Yes. 

I personally think the key is to buy low and sell high. Genius right? But seriously as long as you can be buying when everyone else is scared. Then sell when you have reached a certain level (in the market or return %). Then I think you will do very well with TQQQ. The question becomes what to do in between when you sell and when you buy again. Many people when they believe a top is reached, they sell TQQQ and buy QQQ to stay in the market.

The real problem scenario for TQQQ would be years of sideways trading. That imposes the volatility drag that people mention, and could result in the fund being down by quite a lot relative to Q even when it’s been 0% y-y.

The problem is that in bear markets, they can create such underperformance that you can lose a very large percentage of your principal, making it very hard to recover if you time it poorly.

ialz1sw,"Two big reasons not to invest heavily in 3x leverage ETFs:

1. The longer you hold them, the most likely it is you'll experience an event that completely wipes out your investment. If the underlying fund drops by over 1/3 (33%) in a day, all of your money will disappear. It's not hard to imagine such a thing happening, and you certainly won't want to lose all of your money at the same time as severe economic turmoil (which would likely coincide with such a steep market drop).

2. They don't fare well under volatility. If the underlying index is worth $100 and goes up $1, followed by down $1 the next day, and so on for a full trading year (250 days), the price of the underlying index will remain unchanged. The triple-leveraged ETF, on the other hand, will have lost 7.1% of its value. If the index goes up and down every day by $2, the 3x ETF will lose 25.3% of its value.",1653959213,5,investing,v1dkf6,/r/investing/comments/v1dkf6/is_there_something_im_missing_leverage_etfs_seem/ialz1sw/

So if you are a vampire or a celestial or other immortal being, then by all means have at it. But for humans, its probably not worth it. 

This idea gained a lot of popularity in the bogleheads forum a few years back when a user named HEDGEFUNDIE suggested it. There was a lot of debate back and forth, because the math of it does work out, but if there was a crash, it would take centuries to recover. HEDGEFUNDIE did it anyway.

You need to be explicit about what you are saying. What is the leverage and rebalancing approach you are advocating for?

I'm asking as with 2x leverage, you go to zero (i.e., you are done) with a 50% drawdown unless you are rebalancing (i.e., making your notional position smaller) as you go down.

BTW, I agree that as long as you don't hit zero, you will increase your return with leverage. It should be obvious. But if you hit zero, it is all over. And if you use too much leverage you will be hitting zero.",1654037630,1,investing,v1dkf6,/r/investing/comments/v1dkf6/is_there_something_im_missing_leverage_etfs_seem/iapwfhc/

iamyxp1,"1. It isn’t a “free lunch strategy”. Learn about the CAPM- it doesn’t stop at a beta of 1. It is just more return for more risk- that’s all. No one said a free lunch. Don’t strawman me. Going from 1.0X to 1.5X leverage increases systematic risk and return. That isn’t a free lunch anymore than going from 50% stocks to 100% stocks increases returns. 

2. Eh, I enjoy debating. I’m trying to find people to debate on the merits of reasonable leverage over long time horizons. It’s a shockingly underexplored concept honestly that fascinates me, I enjoy writing about it. 

3. I don’t know what you have against backtests. Literally since 1920 2X leverage has resulted in more than triple the average ending balance assuming you DCA with UPRO’s fee and spread structure. 
4. If you have legitimate arguments 2X leverage does not result in higher ending balance, I would love to have a good faith debate on the subject. You say you don’t like backtests- I gave you the CAPM as an academic argument leverage can increase returns. What is it you want?

iaooshi,"CAPM is expected return and rarely matches the reality. Its just a theoretical model. Also anybody that knows the theory doesnt even use CAPM anymore, but the five factor model. LETF isnt simply increasing beta on the proportion of leverage, because theres a implementation problem brought by the rebalancing at the end of every day.

Backtests are fine, the problem is people blindly believing that whatever they found in it will happen again in the future. Your strategy must be based on strong investment fundamentals, whatever variables were present in the past might not be in the future. There are many statistical limitations with backtests, they work better as a diagnostic tool for a past period than as a predictive tool for the future.

Also UPRO starts on 2007 and 2010 for 2x and 3x, whatever youre backtesting is not the product youre investing. Google up ""tracking error"". On the long term, these products are not the same as being levered 2x/3x on S&P.

Again, CAPM dont hold up empirically. Theres always difference between expected and actual returns. Also theyre not an ""argument leverage can increase returns"" when talking about presently available LETFs. Yes, levering an asset that have higher returns than the rate of borrowing obviously would lead to higher returns than the underlying assets, you dont even need to backtest for that. The problem is LETFs have an implementation problem to deliver exactly that.

The sarcasm is based on whenever someone is trying to convince others that their strategy is a winner thats because they dont know what theyre doing and are too excited about a subject that is new to them.",1654017968,4,investing,v1dkf6,/r/investing/comments/v1dkf6/is_there_something_im_missing_leverage_etfs_seem/iaooshi/

Im done with this discussion because i really dont care. Youre excited about something you found out and i know how that is, theres no really point on discussing it. Stick to your backtests for predicting the future and your crusade on other subs for convincing people that your strategy works.

Look at the exposure, the top holdings are Nasdaq 100 swaps sold by banks

You may look at the price today versus the price in 2021 and think it's relatively cheap but that's not the case because a lot of the value lost is not coming back. It's not value lost in companies, it's in contracts that went to 0. 

Nasdaq 100 may do well in for 10 years but if it hits a really bad stretch for a very short amount of time your leveraged ETF can go to nothing.

go2pcdb,As a holder of TQQQ and have been since 2017 I would recommend having a strategy. A lot of people misunderstand how the market works. The market has halts in place if the market sells off at 7% which stops the market for 15 minutes. Plenty of time to get.out of TQQQ at 21% loss. I personally buy above the 200 dma and sell when it dip below it. This was back tested on seeking alpha for upro on a daily triple leverage etf all the way back to 1933 and captured an annualized rate of return of 16% by following this strategy. I prefer tqqq because tech is the way. I still hold tqqq and will not sell unless under 200 dma. I only do this with 10% of my portfolio and it has doubled and tripled many times already.

goe8u5d,"I think many people here, when they are talking about ""decay"", don't quite get it. Sorry.  Investing in leveraged ETFs is not about decay.

It is about volatility and DCA.

If you invest $1 in TQQQ in 2010, it is worth $100 today.

If you put in $100 in TQQQ today, I'm very confident that in 10 years, it'll be a lot more than if it were to put that $100 into something like SPY, or QQQ.

As long as QQQ goes up over time, TQQQ will go up over time.  3x that much. Likely more than 3x that much.

So what's the problem?  The problem is that as an investor, you do not put all of your money into TQQQ at once.  You don't have all the money you invest.  You get paid monthly and make investments monthly -- or periodically.   This is where the volatility of TQQQ can hurt you, when you buy in at the wrong time.

While adding leverage to an already volatile category of equities is a risky proposition, the added leverage has other considerations as well. The two biggest are the high expense ratio and leverage decay. In today's era of ultra low cost investing, the .95% ratio takes a chunk of your annual returns. Leverage decay is a natural and unfortunate loss of capital due to volatile movements.

Here is a mathematical example:

Day 1 - Down 10% to $90 per share (assuming a cost basis of $100)

Day 2 - Up 10% to $99 per share

Day 3 - Down 5% to $94.05 per share

Leverage decay is a natural and unfortunate loss of capital due to volatile movements.

If the fed saves the market again by printing money. The rich get richer, the poor stay what they are. Of course the financial assets and real estates become more and more expensive. But as long as the inflation of the basic needs(food, gas etc.) is under control, the economy moves forward.

m3fljpb,"Problem with TQQQ - like all leveraged ETFs - is just math. Suppose for example our hypothetical underlying, $FOO, is $100, and our triple-leveraged etf, $TFOO, is also $100. Imagine one day FOO goes up 10% to $110. Then the next day it goes down 9% back to $100.10. Over the same period of time, TFOO will go up 30% to $130, then down 27% to ... $94.90.

This is an extreme example of some pretty high movement, though you could see this kind of scale in realtime with stuff like leveraged MSTR or BTC ETFs this year. The intuition on a leveraged ETF is that it has a magical price from which all movement gets compressed around, but that only baits people in. Think about a stock that goes up 1000% and then down 100%. Now imagine a 3x leveraged ETF where the underlying went up 1000%... and then down 34%. Downside movements are amplified disporportionately.

So this is why people don't recommend leveraged ETFs longterm. Stocks tend to trade pretty sideways. They meander up and down, and even if the sustained movement is up, on a leveraged ETF the downs can easily wipe out all the ups while the underlying is still going up over time. In a raging bull market like we've had this year, the green days can be so consistent that you make bank on the leverage. TQQQ is up something like 64% this year, far more than the actual QQQ. But look at the 5 year charts and you'll see the effect that this bleeding has had even right after a parabolic run up.

imo chasing TQQQ is just overfitting historical performance. the last decade and a half has been pretty much a perfect storm for tech companies to grow aggressively and also all of the drawdowns have been aggressively Vshaped- which is historically unlikely. both harder drawdowns and slower, more prolonged drawdowns/bleeding would wreck these funds.

The question is, was the TQQQ $10,000 buy really worth $320,000? If we assume the QQQ will trend higher over say four decades, could we likewise assume buying a small amount, and adding on extreme drawdowns, would significantly outperform QQQ?

khw69u0,"Leveraged funds are daily rebalanced, which turns into something called “slippage”, in the long term, if the fund experiences a period of losses, it can wipe out years of gains.

Example of slippage: 
Day 1: SPY @500, 1x fund @500, 3x @500
Day 2: SPY goes down 10 points, 1x fund @490, 3x @470
Day 3: SPY goes up 10 points back to Breakeven 500, 1x fund @500, 3x fund @**498.78**
The reason is because they rebalance daily so instead of their gain being based off the original 500, it’s based off their 470, cause it’s rebalanced *daily* and not *indefinitely* as it is in a regular portfolio

Over time slippage gets worse and worse, and is more extreme through higher volatility.

Okay, why don’t funds just not rebalance daily? 
1. Well, if the underlying product goes down -33% or more, the fund goes defunct (for 3x leverage) within a day this is highly unlikely, but given a long enough time frame, it’s very likely to happen eventually and it’s safe to say no bank is going to take that trade, pretty much inevitable loss
2. As your fund value strays further away from the original price, the exact amount of leverage shifts, if you don’t rebelance at all, and the underlying goes up +100%, the fund is no longer 3x leverage, it turns into 2x, so the fund would no longer be able to claim their exact leverage. When dealing with daily values, the spread is much tighter although their leverage technically does change throughout the day (98% of daily movements in the market is +/-3%, minuscule compared to long term “volatility”)",1705277795,24,investing,196rwjl,/r/investing/comments/196rwjl/leveraged_etfs_am_i_just_not_understanding/khw69u0/

khvp8ho,"The levered ETF returns triple the % DAILY return of the underlying index, so it won’t necessarily return 3x over a longer period of time. You also have to factor in borrowing costs which add a drag.

For example, say you hold $100 of QQQ and it drops 10% on day 1 to $90, and then rises 11% on day 2 back to $100. TQQQ will drop 30% on day 1 to $70 and then rise 33% on day 2 to $93.5. This is an example of beta decay / volatility decay. Volatile markets cause you to underperform 3x over a period of time. On the other hand smooth, upward trending markets will mean the levered ETF performs better than 3x over time. 

I do believe there can be a place for levered ETFs as part of a balanced portfolio. If you have a long enough time horizon and a strong enough stomach, a DCA strategy can outperform over time, especially very long time horizons. During the financial crisis you would have had to deal with 95%+ drawdowns from peak to trough, and it took roughly a decade to get back to where you were. For levered ETFs, timing the market beats time in the market unless we are talking about a period of 50+ years, when even lump sum levered ETFs strategies can win. 

You have to ask yourself if you really do have a strong enough stomach for it. Most people realise in bear markets that their risk tolerance is a lot lower than they expected!

So I mean with leveraged ETFs it can work both ways.

I am personally following this but with 1.5x leverage and using VWRA instead of CSPX to reduce risk.

nhpp7e8,"There’s a very simple explanation for this. In the long-term, you will lose with leverage. Looking at the US stock market throughout history is quite interesting. There has been a general upward trajectory all throughout its history, with dips as a result of recessions and market corrections along the way. It’s easy to assume you’d just see better returns if you used a leveraged ETF, but that’s just not the case.

Take QQQ as an example, the Nasdaq index. The leveraged version of the QQQ is the TQQQ, which was created in 2010. If you back date the TQQQ to the 90s, you would find that if you had bought into the TQQQ during or prior to the tech bubble, you would still be down on your investment today, whereas if you had bought into the QQQ you would be up over 1000% even if you bought at the peak of the dot-com bubble. This is because losses are also multiplied, and losses hit harder than gains. If you lose 30% in a normal etf, the stock has to go up 43% to make up for that loss, but if you had a 2x leverage on that 30%, you would be down 60%, and thus need the stock to go up 250% to go back to even. This fact is why leverage is a bad idea, the losses can wipe you out.

The other problem with leverage is stagnation. When the market stays pretty much even, you lose money with a leveraged etf. With a normal stock that trades at let’s say $100, if it goes up 5% to $105, then down 5% you end up with $99.75. Pretty much the same place. But with a 2x leverage on that, you go up to $110, and down to $99. Replay that cycle for years on end in a stagnant market, and the leverage ETF can be down huge amounts, like >50% when the actual market has stayed even. 

The S&P 500 has been an interesting one, because you would be up higher than with a normal ETF had you bought at any point in the last 60 years. But the US stock market has been an exception to the rule, because the US is the only country to my knowledge where a leveraged would have beaten a regular ETF over the last 60 years ago, 50 years ago, or even 40 years ago. The S&P 500 has been unusually consistent with its consistent growth. But that isn’t to say that this has always been the case, because a leveraged ETF prior to 60 years ago would have been a terrible bet, with the Great Depression being particularly bad. I had read somewhere that a leveraged S&P 500 ETF from the peak of the great depression to now would STILL be below where it was at the peak. All it takes is one really poorly performing period, and you have lost everything. 

So in summary, leveraged ETFs lose in the long run. If you plan to invest your entire life, the odds of a long term market downturn occurring are almost inevitable. That once in 50 or 100 year cycle is so brutal for leveraged ETFs that they mitigate all the benefits and more. The final thing I will leave you is with this. Can you find me a 60 year period that is NOT the last 60 years of the S&P 500 where leveraged market index would outperform the regular market index? I have yet to find one myself. The Japanese market has never had such a period, neither has the British, German, French, Korean, Indian, or any other market. The S&P 500 is the exception to the rule, the lone outlier. Do you want to bet that it will be the lone outlier for the next 60 years as well?

Also, the opposite of volatility decay also happens: if a down day follows a down day, you're down less than 2x the movement of the underlying asset, and if an up day follows an up day, you're up more than 2x. This never gets brought up for some reason.

A very high leverage ratio will absolutely decay enough to end up underperforming and even going to zero, but 2x really ain't that extreme.

>over time, the returns start to get very skewed. The longer you hold onto these leveraged ETF products, the bigger the disparity in returns you'll see (and it's not in your favor). This is called decay - specifically leveraged ETF decay.


Just read about it. 


If you want leverage for longer term horizons that behaves like you want it to intuitively, you *will need to pay for that* need you're getting a loan, essentially.


So you want long dated call options or to invest on margin. If course both of these cost money, but nothing is free.

nhsch4t,">There’s a very simple explanation for this. In the long-term, you will lose with leverage.

That's not actually true.  2x has a historical CAGR [1.5% higher](https://testfol.io/?s=iJYJJp6fahg) than 1x's historical CAGR.  Click the rolling metrics tab to see 60 year average returns.   

>But the US stock market has been an exception to the rule, because the US is the only country to my knowledge where a leveraged would have beaten a regular ETF over the last 60 years ago

nhp1xu0,"I love LETFs but basically everything you said here is wrong and misguided lol. First of all, they’re completely path dependent because they’re daily reset. That means that you don’t just deviate from the daily leverage by a little, but you can deviate from it by any amount. Saying you get 2.5 times the performance of the index is just grossly incorrect. You could underperform the index in bear markets, sideways markets, and even markets that are trending upwards if they’re volatile enough. You absolutely cannot make any statements about the long term returns of an LETF just by knowing what the index has done in that time, because the LETFs are path dependent and daily reset with their leverage. You can overperform the leverage target, and also massively underperform. Also, TQQQ was made in 2010. We’ve literally had a massive tech bull market since then. Everyone’s a genius in a bull market. If you simulate an investment into TQQQ right before the dot com bubble, you’d still be down more than 50% on that investment. 25 years later. So maybe try to think on a longer time horizon than a 15 year bull market lol. In general 3x leverage is inferior to 2x leverage when it comes to buy and hold. Leveraged ETFs are relatively new products, but if you simulate them on market data from well before their conception, you see that the optimal leverage for buy and hold is somewhere around 2x (this depends on the volatility of the underlying index though). LETFs are a great tool, but you don’t seem aware of the massive drawdowns possible with them, mostly because you haven’t had to live through them.

nhp5vif,"You’ve got a point, in fact the daily optimal leverage value could even be less than 1x (no leverage)

Volatility decay is governed by a pretty simple formula: (1 - x)(1 + x) = 1 - x^2. Returns decay by the square of the daily change

So in a really volatile market you could have better returns by having 0.5x leverage

To your point, it’d be a mathematical miracle for “1x” leverage to be optimal (and by a measure theory definition, a probability of 0)

I can’t remember the exact values but I think historically for SP500 it’s 1.6x, where as in the Nikkei 225 it was something like 0.7x

A lot of people just parrot the idea that volatility decay is a death spiral, without understanding how it works, or the fact you’re already being affected at 1x leverage (I.e. no leverage)

nhqk9f6,"""Cost of debt"", or rather overnight interest rate levels, absolutely do matter for leveraged ETFs. Total return swaps and futures are financing products, so it is in fact very similar to buying on margin. When buying a total return swap on an index, you receive the performance of the underlying index for a given notional exposure, and pay an interest rate on that same notional exposure. A 2x levered S&P 500 ETF with $100M of AUM would typically invest $100M in S&P 500, and buy a TRS on an additional $100M (alternatively invest $100M in money market instruments and buy $200M of TRS exposure). It ends up receiving the performance of S&P 500 on a total of $200M, and pay interest (e.g. 4% at the current overnight interest rate levels + the extra spread you mentioned) on $100M. So higher interest rates do make leverage more expensive in the sense of diminished returns above 1x leverage, be it through levered ETFs, futures, buying on margin, etc. I am not disagreeing with the fact that optimal leverage is > 1x, just that it does depend on the level of interest rates.",1759593835,3,investing,1nxpeth,/r/investing/comments/1nxpeth/if_investing_into_snp500_is_common_advice_with/nhqk9f6/

nhpb46e,"This is a great question. I’ll assume we’re talking about America here for tax purposes, as that’s what I’m familiar with. In general, with futures contracts, you take on all the risk. You know how LETFs are daily reset? Well with futures, you have to manage your leverage yourself, so your leverage will only reset when you enter or exit out of contracts. Additionally, you carry the risk of these contracts. If the market drops enough, these contracts can even take your account into the negatives, and you’ll lose all your collateral and potentially even owe money. ETFs don’t have a structure that allows them to go below 0. The fund might end up with debt, but you as an investor are shielded from that liability. So essentially, you’re paying the leveraged ETF an expense ratio to take on the risk associated with the leverage, and handle resetting the leverage every day and managing the positions (LETFs don’t usually actually use futures to achieve leverage but that’s a different story). So, what’s the advantage of futures? Well, you can control exactly how much leverage you use, and also there’s no expense ratio that you pay. However, there are many downsides. You have more risk, it takes a lot of time to manage your positions, in volatile markets you need to constantly monitor your contracts to make sure your leverage doesn’t drift too far, and also the tax treatment in America for them is not great, because you pay taxes on your gains every year, since the value of the contracts is paid out or debited from your account every day. ETFs are more tax efficient than futures contracts in America, especially if you don’t sell your ETFs. Also, futures are just generally more complicated, and you have margin requirements, other nuances, etc. In general, the consensus is that LETFs are the best and most tax efficient way for retail investors to use leverage.",1759578128,8,investing,1nxpeth,/r/investing/comments/1nxpeth/if_investing_into_snp500_is_common_advice_with/nhpb46e/

nht6k2c,"How do you get 2x leverage on $100? By borrowing another $100 and buying $200 worth of stocks. Leveraged ETFs use total return swaps to achieve this rather than outright borrowing money, but the result is the same, and they pay interest on that $100 of borrowed money.

The interest accrual is not part of the expense ratio. It is accounted for on a daily basis in the NAV. And yes, if you regress the daily NAV returns of a leveraged ETF onto the daily returns of the underlying index, you will find that the daily underperformance relative to 2x/3x the index is close to the listed expense ratio + the interest paid on the swaps. You need to correctly account for day count conventions to get a precise measurement (e.g. weekends accrue three days of interest).

You can even see the interest rate paid on each swap (these ETFs actually transact with multiple investment banks) in the N-PORT forms filed with the SEC. For example, this is the latest N-PORT filing for ProShares SSO: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1174610/000175272425180300/xslFormNPORT-P_X01/primary_doc.xml

To me, what is appealing about leveraged etfs for a longer term hold is that you can have confidence in buying a dip for the same reason you can have confidence buying a dip in VOO or VTI: you know it will go back up.  I am thinking of shifting more of my portfolio to leveraged S&P and NASDAQ etfs for this reason (currently in SSO).  Will your portfolio bleed during a draw down?  Yes.

For simplicity let's say TQQQ was also started at 1400, it would do this:
1400 > 1101.8 > 1356.32

So you end up with ""less"" money as in it doesn't return to 1400 even though the Nasdaq did. This happens because the 3x leveraged applies to the % change and not the $ change in value. So you're not actually losing money, it's just how the math works out.

If TQQQ was 3x the dollar value (hypothetically), then it would do what you except intuitively:

gt7jomo,"Depends on you really.. if I mention % allocation it might be risky or not a good financial advice

* The greatest fear of LETFs is the fund imploding, illiquid or wiped out in a true bear market/heavy crash; or having recovery delays
* Advantage of modern days are that the stock market today is pretty stable, the companies are very profitable. Shouldn't be a guarantee.. but the performance is there (unlike 70-90s where tech/services isn't mainstream)

While LETFs are nice & does leverage down in a bear/sharp crash, a 40-50% down could be a disaster

Very true for 3x, that's why long term 2x is better (especially near your retirement)

I say if you're young... 30-70% (smaller in 3x), be sure to have cash on hand or in much stabler blue chip stocks

3x early is great because the compounding is worth it. Now past performance doesn't reflect future... but if there's a slightest/slow Bull in SPY or QQQ

2/3x are still worth it.. if you looked at 2010-2020 QLD vs TQQQ

k4gmizj,"Your premise that ""the market always goes up"" is clearly wrong. Markets go down or sideways for years or decades. In the very long run, they are expected to go up, but that is not always the case in the short to medium term. This is especially true for less diversified, tech-heavy indexes like the Nasdaq index (which TQQQ leverages).

Not only would TQQQ do terribly if the market goes down, but it can also do very poorly if the market goes sideways due to volatility decay. Suppose the index starts at 100 on day 1. On day 2, it goes up to 110 (+10%). On day 3, it goes back down to 100 (-9.1%). If you just owned the QQQ index, you would be even.

However, if you bought TQQQ, you would be down. On day 2, the 10% increase would be a 30% increase (3 x 10%) in your value. On day 3, the 9.1% drop would be a 27.3% drop (3 x 9.1%) in your value. The combination of a 30% increase followed by a 27.3% drop would leave you down by over 5.5% from where you started (1.3 x 0.727). If the market trades flat like this for extended periods of time, you could see a large chunk of your value disappear.

In addition, you are paying 86bps in management fees per year on TQQQ, instead of 20bps on QQQ, or 3bps on VOO, which is a further drag on returns.

Even if the market eventually does go up, you could end up worse off than a regular index investor if the volatility decay and higher expense ratio draw down enough of your balance before the market increases happen.",1697053311,6,investing,175ml9o,/r/investing/comments/175ml9o/if_the_market_always_goes_up_why_not_only_buy/k4gmizj/

k4kjb06,"because of the compounding effect. The market goes up in the long term, but often move ""lateral"".
E.g. the market goes up +5% and next day it goes down -5%.
That's almost the same, you don't gain and you don't lose right? Nope: with 3x leverage you lose.
Let's do some calculation: suppose it start at 100, then it does +5%, TQQQ will go up +15% at 115.
Then the market lose 5% then 105-5%=99,75.
TQQQ will lose -15% so 115-15%=97,75.
While without leverage you lose 0,25% with 3x you lose 2,25%.
This effect is even worse if it first lose then it gains, and cumulate over time.
So it's easy that in the long run you will gain without leverage and you will lose with leverage.

dulk8vc,"There is a ton of misinformation in this thread, including highly upvoted posts.  The true, subtle answer as is often the case is that *it depends*.  People are saying the biggest drawback is the slippage cost but it is not actually the biggest drawback all the time.  In current market conditions it is actually a benefit rather than a drawback for sp500 leveraged ETFs, for example.  The other big cost, which historically is extremely high, is the implied interest rate it takes to leverage.  I'll talk about slippage cost first though.

The slippage cost is magnified or actually inverted depending on what the market volatility is.  The prospectus for these funds have a chart showing the impact on what this slippage cost will actually be depending on what the underlying index volatility is.  In the conditions like 2017 with extremely low volatility, the fund *makes* money, not loses it, from this factor overall.  In a sideways year the fund will still lose money.  However, in a down trending or up trending year the fund will lose less than expected or win more than expected.  Look at this chart to confirm:

https://ibb.co/fft18b

You will see that as you go right on this chart that, as index volatility increases, the slippage cost increases / benefit shrinks.

I broke down what the annual sp500 returns were by year over the last 50 to get an idea of what the expected return will be on a given random year.  If you average it out then on here is what happens from slippage:

10% Volatility: UPRO makes 8% more than expected

15% Volatility: UPRO makes 3% more than expected

20% Volatility: UPRO makes 4% *less* than expected

25% Volatility: UPRO makes 12.5% less than expected.

Why does this happen?  In markets that gain and then lose .3% in a day, slippage costs almost nothing when the market breaks even.  It is more likely to actually gain from slippage on +.3%, +.3% when gains over a year are incrementally so small.  Compounding works in your favor more than getting whipsawed hurts you.  Whereas if the market is losing and gaining 10% in a day, you will quickly go broke because even if the underlying index is expected to make 10% in a year, that will translate into too many whipsaw days, which will be the majority.

The numbers stated here can be given some margin for error, in either direction, but not that much.  This is reasonably accurate and stays similar over different time frames.

That is one big component of the cost of this fund.  It isn't the biggest cost most of the time.  The fund fee itself is 1%.  However, there is also an *implied* interest rate that you're paying to hold the fund.  What exactly is this implied interest rate?  For 3x leveraged funds it is (Libor + ~.2%) * 2.7.  In the past few years that expense was very low - almost free in fact.  As libor creeps up to 3+, it starts to become a very significant expense.

Thoughts are: Do not hold leveraged ETFs for long periods of time when interest rates are high or the underlying index volatility is high.  These are both highly predictable things.  Do not hold leveraged ETFs when the market very often goes sideways, as they do for some assets.

Other thought is that for other funds the volatility cost is out of this world.  Index volatility for the nasdaq is about 5% higher than sp500 which will begin to cost very serious money during high volatility periods.  You can see that the cost does not scale linearly from the chart - if your index volatility is 30%+ it is impossible to see how this would be a profitable buy/hold.  Even at 25% it is likely not worth the risk, even when libor is low.  Underlying index volatility for something like YINN means you are in fact incinerating money for the reasons that are getting talked about in this thread.",1519225313,17,investing,7z3flv,/r/investing/comments/7z3flv/eli5_triple_leveraged_etfs/dulk8vc/

Here are some things to keep in mind:

1. The market is timeable

2. The example of ""going up 10% one day then back down 10%"" is totally out of context. The markets have bull runs and bear runs. When you hold a leveraged etf during a bull run, you go up so fast.

3. The betadecay concerns only apply to markets that are going sideways or down. US markets have sustained bull runs, so this concern is totally irrelevant.

4. The forces of compounded interest are very strong. The forces of compounded leveraged interet are astronomical.

No, they borrow from banks.  Basically for every $1 that gets put into $TQQQ, they buy $1 of $QQQ, then borrow $2 more and buy more $QQQ with that.  At the end of the day, they rebalance so that their exposure stays at 3x.

dum7zdu,"The combination of a leveraged asset, with one that is uncorrelated can deliver returns better than an all index portfolio. You can optimize for risk, or for return but rarely both.

For example, let's say you held TQQQ in combination with a CD, or municipal bonds. You may be comfortable with a majority of holding s in munis, in which case yous would be collecting interest with little net depreciation. In a rising market, TQQ compounds gains daily so that the return far exceeds nasdaq. In falling markets it destroys wealth rapidly. However if it's a small share of your portfolio it means that impact is only affecting a smaller and smaller share. So at some point the loss on your overall portfolio is smaller than the underlying index, because the share of your TQQQ in it is small. If you held TQQQ at <40%, then even a worst case scenario, like 2008 would mean you lost less than the Nasdaq overall. At the same time you are collecting interest on your munis, which help with consistent tax free payouts. In a recession environment, interest rates will be coming down, which means that you have historical holdings that are paying above market interest rates. They are more valuable now, so it tends to provide a shield that an all equity or index portfolio won't give you. Time to rebalance, and bring TQQQ back up to a risk level you feel comfortable with.

Tqqq is a complex product that makes it difficult to understand. There are a couple of things said about it that aren't true. You should not be all in TQQQ, or even hold it as a large proportion of your portfolio, You should be aware that because of volatility, it does not exactly track the underlying, and may even fall short.

duld84n,"The problem is the volatility drag. As volatility increases the difference between the average annualized return (what you see on prospecus) and the compounded return (what you receive by buying and holding the stock) also increases. For instance, consider a stock that either goes up 300% or down 100% each year. Is that a good long-term investment, because the average return is 100%? No, because one bad year totally wipes you out. This is why volatility is bad for investors, and why stocks are not strictly superior to bonds.



 For an total-market index fund, the compounded return is typically around 2% less than the average annual return of 10% on average. For a leveraged fund, this difference is multiplied by the leverage amount squared. So for a 3x leveraged fund, the average annual return is 30% but the volatility drag is 18%, for a compounded return of only 12%. 

Things are even worse when you consider that the volatility of the market changes with time.  In an especially volatile week the volatility drag can be much larger than 2%. Imagine it increases to 10%, so that the market's compounded returns are 0 (even though daily returns are still 10%/year on average). Then the volatility drag on the leveraged ETF is 90%, and the ETF loses 60% of its value while the market is flat!

dult7t1,"With daily leverage, higher risk only equals higher reward up to a point. For a long term hold, that point depends on volatility expectations. For example, if you expect the market to have swings of 1% daily, a 100x levered product has a long term expected value of 0. This is clearly worse than the expected return of the unlevered product. 

Assuming unlimited risk tolerance, you can calculate the ideal leverage for the greatest expected return, using modeled values for rate of return and volatility. For example, over the past 20 years, the ideal leverage for SPY was 2.2x.

I understand that some investors have differing risk tolerances, but baking null volatility into your assumptions is just silly. The only way this doesn't apply to you is if you only hold levered products with a short-term (<1 day) thesis. The longer you hold it for, the more you have to factor volatility decay into your decisions.",1519233786,4,investing,7z3flv,/r/investing/comments/7z3flv/eli5_triple_leveraged_etfs/dult7t1/

dunhylf,"Alright I just typed up a response linking to an image of the 2x version of the chart I listed in my first response.  Right before I hit send the power went out so you'll get a more half assed reply this time.

Basically in the exact time period you linked SSO *wins* 5% on the year on slippage, not loses it.  It is actually a bit more than that.  Look up the version of the chart I linked for the 2x version instead to see for yourself.  The index went up 25% and had volatility of 10% or a bit below.  So the win on slippage offset the implied interest rate you would have been paying.

Another thought is that the implied interest rate from SSO is considerably smaller, probably half?  What is going on in UPRO is that .7 of the money in the fund is being used as collateral to fund a 2.7 leveraged position.  The remaining .3 is used to complete the 3x position.  For the 2x fund I suppose then it would work out to .35 of the money is used to fund a 1.35 leveraged portion, with the remaining .65 used to buy the fund itself.  So the amount of interest you're paying for a year is about 7% for the 2x fund for that year's libor.  Is that worth it?  Maybe if volatility is as low as it was to offset this cost.  Personally I think that is quite gambly and not worth the additional return, even if there is one.

Not only are you going to lose almost double the amount on a down year but you'll also be paying interest rate and fund fee for a portion of it.  For example, during the dotcom crash the funds do *WAY* worse because it is paying interest the whole time and would have gone almost completely bust as a result.",1519310290,2,investing,7z3flv,/r/investing/comments/7z3flv/eli5_triple_leveraged_etfs/dunhylf/

j2rcph2,"theres nothing wrong with leverage if you understand it, and if youre going to us it, a daily resetting % change vehicle is the worst possible way to obtain leverage.  you would want to use NQ index futures.  heres a quick back of the envelope example

today NQh3 requires about 17380 (call it 18k) of margin for 1 contract (worth 221k) or about 8% margin.  so if you were to look back 10 years ago the backadjusted NQ1 price is about 1611, and that 8% margin (i know margin rates change over time, its a back of envelope estimate here) means youd need about 2500 to buy 1 contract.

so 10y ago if you bought 2500 of TQQQ you would have a 14.93% return.  if you purchased 3 lots of NQ1 futures and just rolled them quarterly, your return is about 17.58%. the delta in that (\~26bps / year is the dead weight loss of a daily % resetting vehicle vs a quarterly resetting vehicle)

to quote *Market Sense and Nonsense* by Jack Schwager: 

>The failure of investors to understand the negative consequences of volatility on return can lead to unpleasant surprises. A good example of this phenomenon is the experience of many investors who buy leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs). **Typically, investors who buy a leveraged (2×) ETF expect to earn twice the amount as in the corresponding unleveraged ETF if the market advances. Over any extended period of time, however, they typically find the return is less than twice the amount if the market advances and the loss more than twice the amount if the market declines. Analogous comments would apply to leveraged short ETFs—that is, the gains on market declines will tend to be less than twice the market decline and the losses on price advances will tend to be more than twice the price rise.**

gzjqg3j,"The big risk on leveraged ETFs is your ability to hang on to them. Even an index can have 10-15% corrections which would be worse than 30%-45% in a 3x due to compounding.

Also, if there is ever a day where the underlying security drops 20%, you lose 60%. Check out JNUG in March last year. It had multiple sayings in a row for 5% - 20%. Investors who thought they could hold through took a 95% hit that still hasn’t recovered anything close to its previous prices. Leveraged ETFs may never come back from a big drawdown due to compounding losses. There are safety nets in place for the market indexes, but large compounding losses are still very possible.

gzjynqq,"It doesn't matter if they perform in the next 10 years.  In fact, you shouldn't want them to.  For you the investor the ideal is that they stay flat and then ~2x for every decade you've been holding on the day you retire.

The reality is, start getting the money in.  That's all that matters.  The rest will take care of itself.

To put this another way, if you started investing in 1999 and continued investing every month all the way to now, you're sitting on a boat load of money despite the fact that the market went flat overall for 12 years.

I would highly advise you to ignore the leveraged funds.  The biggest factor in you making money is your ability not to sell.  Considering you're already worrying about short term returns, being in leveraged funds is going to make you more likely to sell in a downturn and thus have a negative effect on your returns.

One is that they know it would trigger a meltdown in the economy, which would potentially terminally damage their political stability, and two is that Taiwan is more valuable as a political enemy than as a province.

gjo57wz,"Leveraged funds in sectors I think are a bad idea, like gold, oil, whatever.

Indeces are a different story. Every horror-story about leveraged funds uses the same volatility drag argument about 100$ up 10% to 110$ down 10% to 99$ and your fund is down to like 92$ and you die. Problem is, and you can check this, the indeces all go up roughly 66% of the time, I think dow does like 72% of the time for one time period I checked. So volatility drag isn't true for INDEX LEVERAGED.

People also mention fees, 1% fee is supposed to drop the effect of leveraging to below the expected, such that 2 or 3x leveraged is only really the same performance as 1x leverage. This is false, in fact tqqq outperforms the programmatic 3x target in my testing.

Crash recovery, I mean this really depends on the resiliency of the fund. TQQQ was in a ROUGH and dangerous spot in march. But the amount of capital it has gives it some resilience. You can see in the lower volume ETFs, like the direxion 2 or 3x SP500, they fail to hit their leverage target. This can be a problem, so I would only use highly liquid funds with a lot of activity. Aside from some jaw dropping falls of 70+%, these climb out of holes just fine if the indeces do. however, if you sell, like a lot of people will want to, you're screwed.

I have done fairly extensive back-testing to try and find buy-sell signals using moving averages, MACD type stuff, also interest rates growth and shrinkage, and stop-losses, and I cannot find any signal that works when backtested over the full index histories I have (\~40 years, dow is longer). Some signals work very very well for an individual year (like it's quite easy to 7x your money in 2020, if you just know the magic signal, but that signal is worse than being passive in 2012), but there's no universal strategy I can find.

I think if your horizon is order of years, it's fine, and I'm holding 30% in TQQQ. I am not the kind of person that will NEED that 30% though, so make your own decisions accordingly. This CAN run massive loss for months at a time when it would be catastrophic to pull out.",1610931141,14,investing,kz6fgt,/r/investing/comments/kz6fgt/q_leveraged_indices_sso_upro_tqqq/gjo57wz/

gjo3egw,"I've backtested as long as dow, russel, nasdaq, s&p have been indexes by applying the leverage programmatically.  I can reproduce tqqq from the nasdaq for a given year, but over 3+ years, tqqq strangely always outperforms the programmatic 3x leverage.

It works basically because indeces always go up, actually 66% of days give or take, all 4 major indeces go up. This demolishes the volatility drag ""sideways market"" scenario.

For any yearlong period, the best leverage is either 0x or infinity x. So, with time horizons on the order of years, they can be very very bad investments. Over decades though, all of them work.

I'm not positive how well backtesting works tbh. I'm testing out golden-death-cross and MACD buy-sell signals, and it's just a complete disaster. like 3-15 works well in the last 5 years since it dodges the crash, but not much beats buy-and-hold for 2012-2016/2018, and the stuff that does work, doesn't obviously skip dips, it just hangs on a mathematical optimum. 2001-2007 same story. Even interest rates can't fix it, since flat, descending, ascending all have different buy-sell signals in different eras.

gmvn4ni,"I guess it really depends on the shape of the recovery. For example last 2 weeks we had a few days in a row of 1-2% drops, but that's followed by a day of 3% gain, then slower 1% gain. So if we pretend it's -2% -2% -2% +3% +1%x4 --> unleveraged = 101%, leveraged = 102% ... but if you sell and miss the +3% day unleveraged = 98% and leveraged = 94%

Basically, the reason I think something like tqqq, udow, upro are okay is because they go up 66% of the time (as opposed to focused leveraged etfs in oil or gold or something). Since it's very difficult to predict the direction beyond that (I mean, I've tried with moving averages and such, but it's not apparent to me if you can), each day you basically have a 66% chance, top or bottom.

I think it's more critical at the bottom because rebounds are generally steeper at the bottom (you should check this yourself, this is just a ""feeling"" for me -- for daily swings, covid or catastrophes! I don't know about a slow rolling bear!). So optimally you want to hold at least until recovery is on the way, unless you are better than me at predicting when the drop will continue and it's good to get out.

So basically I think near the bottom, each day you have a 66% chance of it going up, and the farther down you are, the larger the bounce will be. So selling then is much worse than selling any other day.

To play safe, I think a strategy like this works well: when it's down 5%, buy 5%, when it's up 5%, sell 5%, but only sell at or above your previous sell price. (but watch out for taxes)

gjoat6a,"My 40 year data is pulled from yfinance using the index tickers

sp500, nasdaq, russel, dow = '\^GSPC', '\^IXIC', '\^RUT', '\^DJI'

I'm applying the 3x leveraging by multiplying the daily price change percentage at close by 3. This tracks tqqq well for yearlong stretches, although tqqq seems to actually outperform the target and the difference becomes noticeable over 3+ year stretches.

I also did a bunch of reading via the google. I came to the conclusions 1) volatility drag doesn't matter for index leveraged funds since the underlying have 66% positive trends (it's probably bad for something like gold or oil leverage) 2) admin fees do not actually drawdown the performance to be on par with the underlying index 3) catastrophic drops pull out over long (5 years to be safe) timescales 4) there's no magic buy-sell signal that works for timeframes longer than a couple of years, and they change based on year 5) any given year the optimal leverage is either 0x or inf x, over lifetimes only russel and s&p prefer 2x over 3x (I think that the nikkei actually prefers 1x, which was odd, I haven't tested this one myself).

that's my backtesting vs the common arguments I see in articles. Caveat though, I doubt the usefulness of backtesting since I can't find a buy-sell signal that works for a large stretch, even though there are some amazing ones for each year.

gjodffk,"It's...not simple.  I have avoided using margin and have not used leveraged ETFs.  However, this has more to do with my personal risk tolerance. (I'm a chicken and I know it.) 

I can't help but think that leveraged ETFs, regardless of history, are probably a bad idea.  It wouldn't be difficult for them to lose and lose big.  Additionally, they tend to charge a pretty decent fee.  Leverage on margin is interesting.  Using 1% margin is probably decent; you are very unlikely to get margin called, for example.  You'll probably magnify your returns by a tiny bit, as market growth usually exceeds the interest charged on margin. (I've thought of investing on margin as the opposite of keeping a portion of your account in cash.  With margin, you're paying interest to magnify your returns.  With cash, you're getting interest, but your returns are muted.) The big question, though, is where do you draw the line?  10%?  30%?  At some point, you're running high risks of getting margin called due to volatility.  

In short, I don't have answers on which is preferable.  I've always taken the view that you should deeply understand the mechanics of whatever you are doing, but that the level of risk is up to the individual.

To me, investing in the S&P500 is good but suboptimal and the sense of safety compared to the NASDAQ is largely an illusion due to the fact that US stocks are so highly correlated to each other. The idea that the S&P500 is more diversified than the NASDAQ is largely a myth.

Obviously the S&P500 *is* the slightly ""safer"" option, but I think you give up too much in returns. Almost every year since 2009 that hasn't been a ""bad""/negative year for the stock market, the NASDAQ-100 has gained more than the S&P500, and sometimes by a large margin. Once you apply 3x leverage to that shit the difference is massive: If you had invested $10k in March 2010 in both UPRO/TMF (70/30) and TQQQ/TMF (70/30), you would've ended last year with $305k and $937k respectively. Imo that's just way too big of a price to pay for some extra ""diversification"" and the reduced potential threat of a dot-com crash, in which case you being leveraged to the tits is not gonna save you anyways, lest we forget that the S&P500 also lost considerably during that time. 

There are just too many Boomer companies that are on the decline (Ford, Exxon Mobil, Wells Fargo, Citi, etc.) that weigh down the returns of the S&P500, whereas the NASDAQ is filled to the brim with growth stocks that have considerably better returns in good years.

k65trc1,">It's long term performance is extremely good. 26.85% over the last 10 years, with other durations also good.

The last 10 years has been an incredibly favorable 10 year span for the US stock market. It is not typical, nor is it a particularly ""long term.""

Leveraged ETFs are generally bad for long term holding for several reasons.

First, they suffer from volatility decay. If the stock market goes up, and then goes back down to the same point it started at, a leveraged ETF will lose money. The same also happens if the stock market goes down, and then goes back up to the same point it started at.

As an example, suppose the stock market is currently at 100. On day 1, it increases by 10% to 110. On day 2, it decreases 9.09% back down to 100. An index investor who owns the index has broken even. An investor who holds a 2x leveraged fund will experience a 30% increase on day 1, followed by a 27.27% loss on day 2. The net result is a 5.1% loss.

You can also run this from the other direction. Let's say instead the stock market goes down 10% to 90 on day 1, and then increases by 11.1% back to 100 on day 2. The 2x leveraged fund will have a net loss of 6.7%.

While these return numbers are a bit exaggerated, it's not uncommon for the stock market to bounce up and down for months or years at a time. This volatility gradually erodes your wealth in the long term. 

Second, they charge higher fees. QLD charges you 0.95% every single year, compared to 0.20% for regular QQQ (or 0.03% for VTI/VOO). These fees also erode your wealth over the long term.

Third, leveraged ETFs get their leverage from borrowing money, either directly or indirectly through options/futures. The cost of leverage varies directly with interest rates. As interest rates continue to increase, the cost of acquiring this leverage will continue to increase.",1698095975,36,investing,17euxkr,/r/investing/comments/17euxkr/qld_why_all_the_warnings_to_not_hold_it_long_term/k65trc1/

hl1mhel,"Its caused by rebalancing. Over longer periods of decline or flat violitile markets, a leveraged position will suffer. 

Take a super simple example. ETF and LETF, both start at 100$. Underlying drops 10 percent then goes up 10 percent every other day for a month. Do the math as far along as you want. 

Also a single black swan event will wipe out ALL your gains for however long you have invested. Say the market goes up for 10 years in a row, then drops 35% in a day cause NewCovid happens. Those 10 years of gains totally get wiped out with the leveraged etf, but still sitting on great overall gains.

Also because of rebalancing, let's say you have a SPY leveraged etf. 1 year from now, spy is the same price as when you bought it. Because of the daily ups and downs and rebalancing effect, the leveraged etf will actually drop. Depending on violitility it may drop fairly dramatically.

That said, if your youngish, or have a high risk tolerance I do recommend them. Over most 5, 10 year periods they would have done exceptionally well. Over 20 or 30 year periods, not as much.",1637187609,2,investing,qw6lui,/r/investing/comments/qw6lui/given_an_infinite_time_period_what_is_the_problem/hl1mhel/

The problem with levereged etfs is they usually have a built in kill switch related to outflows. When they go to 0 from a rogue wave there's not much time to bail even at a substantial loss",1637177990,3,investing,qw6lui,/r/investing/comments/qw6lui/given_an_infinite_time_period_what_is_the_problem/hl0ytn7/
hl0y4c2,"Most are rebalanced daily, so it’s 3x leverage per day. 

If you have a 10% gain in the ETF then the leveraged would have a 30% gain. If you had a 10% loss the leveraged would have a 30% loss. 

So the ETF is at $100, loses 10% and is at $90. The 3x ETF was at $100 and now it’s at $70. For the standard ETF you need an increase of about 11% to return to the $100 mark where it was. For the leveraged ETF you need almost 43% gains. 

So if the ETF at $100 dropped 10% in a day, and then gained 11% the following day to $100, your 3x leveraged etf would be at $93.10, so you’re still down.

Sometimes it will have down years but over a long enough time frame it gets back to that figure.

For some reason when talking about LETFs more conservative investors abandon this principal. This commenter is never going to be able to explain 'the way the percentages work your losses hurt worse' because that's just incorrect. We know that's not the case for the S&P so how could it be the case for a 3x S&P? Over certain periods of time, yes, your losses would be amplified and, despite what they may say or think, that can cause even the most stoic investors to cut their losses prematurely. That's the biggest risk. We're talking drawdowns of 50-90%.

Over a long enough time frame, and with some degree of hedging, these funds are a way to amplify the market-always-goes-up principal with a widely-acceptable degree of risk.

Market goes down 10%, you’re now at $90. Market rises 10% from 90, you’re now at $99 for a one dollar loss. 

Two big things kill LETFs from what I’ve read: markets trading sideways, due to the example above, and markets taking a major plunge. The plunges can take forever to recover from, sometimes FAR longer than if you held the non-leverage. 

The only thing that makes LETFs viable is the fact that the stock market tends to be trend upwards over time and we don’t tend to trade sideways for long periods of time. 

The other way to make LETFs work is to constantly be buying into them so that your cost basis is constantly adjusting. This way if the market does plunge, you can be buying in for a very low price and then ride the rise back up.

kzztvij,"Given an asset with volatility (not a money market) there is a spread between the arithmetic return and the geometric return.  For example for stocks the arithmetic return is about 10% annually while the geometric return (what your account grows by) is only about 8.17% because of the ups and downs.   The greater the volatility the greater the spread. Volatility increases linearly with leverage: i.e. at 2::1 leverage you get twice the volatility of 1::1 leverage.   Arithmetic return with leverage increases by \`return of asset X - money market interest\`.  Which is to say as the leverage increases the ratio between arithmetic return of the leveraged asset and volatility of the leveraged asset decreases.   Or to rephrase the 2nd derivative of the geometric return with respect to leverage is heavily negative.   This causes geometric return to decrease as leverage gets high enough.  

  
At constant 5::1 leverage given the SP500 regularly goes below -20% the geometric return would be -100%.  You are describing daily 5::1 leverage.  This would be somewhat better than fixed leverage.  But likely things would work out rather terribly.  FWIW 3x leveraged ETFs DCAed into over 40 years outperform 1x leverage.

l02o1xc,"Because you can't affordably borrow large sums of money to bet on the S&P 500 for 30 years.

Borrowing money to invest is called *leveraging* and it increases your returns but it also increases your risk.

When you earn money from leveraging, you are being compensated for taking the additional risk.

The person that lends you the money could themselves invest in the S&P 500 - they're choosing not to; they are exchanging the higher expected returns of the S&P 500 for the fixed returns that you have promised to pay them.

And your lender won't give you the money without security - i.e. they can margin call you, phone you up and demand money if you're under collateralised. That's where leveraging usually goes wrong.

If you read Hedgefundie's excellent adventure you will note his observations that it messes with your head to have your net worth leap up and down, on a daily basis, by several times your monthly salary. It makes you eat out and take taxis more because the costs of these ""don't matter"" when your portfolio is up or down $10,000 in a day - most people don't have the discipline to ignore this.

That said, leverage is a valid investing tool if used properly and if you can stomach the volatility. Ayres and Nalebuff’s “Lifecycle Investing”  suggests that young people should leverage their stock investments, because their assets are concentrated in bond-like human capital. They suggest capping leverage at 1.5-2x, and they suggest more appropriate vehicles for leverage than LETFs, such as in-the-money LEAP call options and futures.

An alternative approach to leverage is the risk parity strategy. That takes a portfolio that has an equal amount of volatility in multiple assets and then levers it. It often looks something like 60% long term bonds and 40% stocks, then leveraged until the portfolio has the desired level of volatility. In theory, that should provide the maximum return for a particular level of risk. It isn’t quite true, because leverage isn’t free, and there is no way to know how much risk you are actually taking in advance.

l00k9gm,"If you're long on the S&P500, leveraged ETFs are a great way to buy into significant downswings (corrections, bear markets, recessions, etc) so that you profit greatly on the way back up. But because the market can go lower, don't put all of your available capital in at the first significant drop. 

Track the all-time S&P500 high. Save money (in a FDIC insured high yield savings account) in 4 different pools to wait for levels at -10%, -20%, -30%, -40% from the all-time high. As those levels hit, invest your allocated pool for that level. If you have the patience, you can save more money for the lower pools to really boost the gains.

Then as your re-allocation markers hit (once a year, once a half, once a quarter - however you prefer), as the stock or leveraged stock allocation (depending on your allocation scheme) of your portfolio goes above your target allocation, then sell enough to bring your allocation into alignment with your plan, pay your estimated taxes, and invest the proceeds in the portion of your portfolio that is under allocated (buy low, sell high).

3x S&P 500 bulls like SPXL have worked very well in this kind of program.

Also, if you're long on the S&P500, leveraged ETFs can be a nice way of boosting profits in the better half of the year (October - April). Allocate a certain portion of your portfolio to leveraged ETFs. 

Then as your re-allocation markers hit (once a year, once a half, once a quarter - however you prefer), as the stock or leveraged stock allocation (depending on your allocation scheme) of your portfolio goes above your target allocation, then sell enough to bring your allocation into alignment with your plan, pay your estimated taxes, and invest the proceeds in the portion of your portfolio that is under allocated (buy low, sell high).

Note that I don't recommend bear leveraged funds (don't bet against the market), and I don't recommend putting all of your resources into any one kind of asset.

I took this even further at one point and built a even more diverse portfolio (leveraged sp500 and NASDAQ leveraged bonds and leveraged REITs and gold) I think it will perform well in the future but the gold has been a drag since it started (even though it's only 5% of the portfolio).

2. **Performance of 2x and 3x ETFs**: 2x and 3x ETFs have been outperforming in recent years due to sustained bull markets. However, they can face significant losses during corrections.
3. **Annualized Returns**: For instance, the annualized return of SPXL (3x SPY) over the last 10 years was 23%, higher than SPY's return of 12.5%. This is because bear markets can be more damaging to leveraged ETFs than bull markets are beneficial.
4. **Volatility Decay**: Leveraged ETFs can suffer from volatility decay over time due to daily compounding of returns, leading to potential devaluation if the market moves sideways or experiences high volatility.
5. **Market Conditions and Leverage Risks**: Leveraged ETFs can be risky in contracting market environments with higher interest rates, which may impact their performance negatively.
6. **Historical Performance**: History shows that lower leverage ratios, such as 1.5-2x, can potentially maximize returns over the long term, while higher leverage ratios might lead to considerable risk and losses.
7. **Decay and Risk Exposure**: Volatility decay, the effect of daily compounding, and increased downside risk can make leveraged ETFs less suitable for long-term holds, especially in volatile or sideways markets.
8. **Management Fees and Performance**: The costs associated with leverage, such as management fees and interest expenses, can impact the overall performance of leveraged ETFs over extended periods.",1728636153,1,investing,1c6bgbd,/r/investing/comments/1c6bgbd/if_the_sp_500_is_so_safe_long_term_why_not_buy/lrdummr/

l00mnmc,"I think of this in simpler terms.  When you buy TQQQ or UPRO, you buy the number of shares.  After 10 years, you still have the same number of shares (after taking into account splitting and so on).  If you track share prices of TQQQ vs QQQ, TQQQ grows faster. Same for VOO vs UPRO.

Now, you pay a higher fee. But there are two reasons that support investing long term in TQQQ instead of QQQ, or UPRO instead of VOO.  First, QQQ/VOO is the underlying force. The correlation is close to 1.  And two, QQQ grows faster.  Therefore, if you believe in the underlying force, you should leverage it.  Higher risk? Yes. High fee? Yes.

l040qq2," If the underlying index moves *up* consistently with decent momentum, volatility decay actually works *in your favor*. This is why UPRO, the 3x leveraged S&P 500 ETF, has delivered close to 5x the returns of the index since its inception instead of the proposed 3x. In short, holding leveraged ETFs for more than a day is not the boogeyman it's made out to be. See the link that shows the math [this page](http://www.ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php).

The article shows that an optimal leverage would be 2X, certainly not 5X lol. Now of course, just because it has been demonstrated in the past says nothing about the future. Most people using leverage will use a mitigation strategy such as TMF.

l001n0b,"Leveraged assets are only good for short term trading when you know/expect that the underlying value will go up.

A, for example, 5x lever on the sp500 basically works like this: if the sp500 goes up by 2%, the lever goes up 10%. Good.

Now, if the sp500 goes down 2%, the lever goes down 10%.
Bad.

Let's do a Gedankenexperiment:

DAY 1: you buy sp500 shares and a 5x levered share for 1000 dollars each.

During the day, the SP500 gains 2%. In your levered share you now have $1100 (+2%). Your unlevered share stands at $1020. 

DAY 2:

The underlying value starts with 0% change compared to the end of the day before. At the end of day 2 it lost 2%.  Your normal shares are now worth 98% of $1020, so $999.60. your levered shares are worth 90% of $1100, which is $990.

*(Edit: apparently this isnt true for leveraged shares but only for (some?) leveraged future commodities) But (Edit: some?) levered shares come with a catch: while normal shares are traded from 7:30 on, (edit: some?) levered shares usually start trading later. While it's true that they are coupled to the underlying value, they do not follow them 1:1. 

If the underlying value is traded at +5% before opening hours, the levered share will only follow movements that happen after 8:00, so you will not benefit from the +5% rise. However, you're very likely to suffer losses during the trading day because there will be downwards movements during the day.*

DAY 3:
Now, on day 3, the sp500 goes up +5% overnight, but due to the mechanism mentioned before, you will not get +25% ,which would raise the value of your share to ~$1240, but instead you'll start the trading day with...$990 (what you had at the end of the last day.

Your regular sp500 shares will start with $1049.58, your levered shares are worth $990.

Now, on day 3, the sp500 loses 2% again but closes with a total gain of 3%. With levered shares, you'll suffer a 10% loss again resulting in $891 even though the underlying value gained about 3% in the three day time period.

So at the end of day 3, your levered shares are worth $891 while your normal shares are $1028.59.


So, while during these three days, the sp500 has gained 2,86%, you have actually lost $109 with your levered shares. So from the $2000 you've invested, you've lost around 4% in three days even though the sp500 went up by 2,86%.

Granted, the example is a bit extreme, but that's for illustrative purposes only. Those negative effects on levered shares add up over time and outweigh the upward potential of a lever. That's why all levered shares eventually fade out towards a value of $0 if they are not terminated before.


A worst case scenario is when you're trading levered shares on volatile values.

E.g. you buy a 5x levered share on a volatile stock which at the moment of purchase trades at $50. Your levered product has a cut-off value of $45, meaning the bank will terminate it once the base value undercuts $45. 

So now on your trading day, your base value starts with $50 and goes up and down a bit during the day. Then around noon, some stupid news arrive, and the stock drops by 10%. It hits $45 and your levered shares are done. Then people buy the dip and the share bounces back to $52. This would actually give you a nice little gain, but since your shares have been terminated, you've lost your money.

l03bnay,">I mean really what difference does a 98% drop in value make vs a 100% drop make? You lost all your money either way.

As long as you don't sell, you don't lose.  Therefore, as long as it's not 0, it's a huge difference. If you bought 100 shares of UPRO 10 years ago, now, you still have 100 shares (after normalizing for splits) in your hands.  This is a significance fact: that as long as you don't sell, you don't lose.

Then, you have to realize that UPRO correlates very well with SP500.  If you look at random prices within a 10-year period, you will see the huge gains between UPRO and SP500 because the price per share of UPRO has increased significantly, compared to that of SP500.  All the large dips in between are just noises.  If you zoom out, the curves of UPRO and SP500 look exactly the same.

If you don't believe me, you can use a tool like portfoliovisualizer to simulate this.  Pick a random 10-year, 5-year, 3-year interval and compare.   I know what I'm talking about because I have done the simulation with my own tools that are more flexible than publicly available tools.

All of these articles about ""volatility decay"" are just theoretical. The math is based on a simple calculation of assuming you lose x% one day and gain x% the next day.  This math is not specific enough. SP500 doesn't lose x% one day and x% the next day.  It tends to go up.  You need to simulate with real historical data.

Market up 1%: Index:  100.978/ 3x:  102.81 / Difference: +$1.832 for 3x

So you can see with more up/down movements the difference between the two become closer until eventually the 1x fund will surpass the 3x fund because the 3x fund is losing more on down swings.

Market up 5%: Index $105 / 3x: $115

- the up/down ratio of the market isn't 50:50, it's 53:47

> On any given day, the odds of the market going up or down are not 50/50. Additionally, stock returns do not follow a normal distribution, as is commonly assumed in many models. On any given day, the market has roughly a 53 percent chance of rising. The odds of the market rising over longer periods increases continually as the time period you're looking at increases. Daily market returns are also streaky. You are statistically more likely to have multi-day winning streaks during uptrends. This plays into our hands.

- The author basically claims that crashes happen when the market is below the 200 SMA. In order to minimize downside risk, he advocates for using a more conservative number. 

> Volatility is almost twice as high when stocks are below their 200-day moving average than when they're above it.

> This indeed allows us to isolate the instances when we are most likely to experience significant market declines and the times when 3x leverage is most likely to underperform the index due to volatility drag.

> By doing this, you also are able to identify environments when market crashes are more likely to occur. As you can see, over two-thirds of the worst trading days for the market occur when the S&P 500 is trading below its 200-day moving average.

....

> Additionally, I recommend a 1 percent band around the 200-day average to prevent being whipsawed as the market hovers near its 200-day average. Let it close 1 to 1.25 percent below before you sell and wait for it to go 1 percent above before you buy. Additionally, you may want to consider using the 150 or 175-day averages as they're less popular with traders. 200-day moving average traders are still smart money, but the fewer people you have selling when you want to sell and vice versa when you buy, the better. I'd use the moving average on the S&P even though we're trading the Nasdaq as it's a volatility forecaster, not a market timing model.

My rebuttal would be that since we are in a crash environment right now, are downside risk exposure is mitigated.   


If your strategy is Dollar Cost Averaging, We have already seen the market drop -33%. What is the rational Maximum we would expect it to drop in total? My Max is personally around 50-60% (Personally an arbitrary number I picked based on past recessions). My expectation is probably 40-50% Until around July just based on past recessions and this specific situation. if the market is down 40% and the expectation is that within 5 years it will be back within all time highs, at a 40% market drop it would take around 66% bull run to recover.  


At a 40% market drop I am risking another 20% drop to make around a 66% gain. I think Dollar Cost Averaging 3X leverage within this risk reward ratio is the strategy that maximizes a 3-5 year bullish investment outlook.

OK so let's see if your claims work out with S&P indexes. 

We're 30% down right now. So let's say you invested in 2008 when the market went down 30% and held until today. That would have been invested on mid September 2008.

I believe my rebuttal to this would be that in your example, we would expect to see that a 3x Leveraged ETF would not perform well over a long time period. **However** we do see that the stock ticker such as TECL or UPRO has consistently been positive over the long run and out perform there non leveraged counterparts such as QQQ and SPY.   


The only downside is a 3x Leverage ETF would seem to underperform if you were to buy them in a bull market right before a crash. Since we already had that crash and we expect to reach a bottom within 2020 or 2021, a leverage ETF seems like the best suited investment to take advantage of our bullish longterm investment thesis.

I'm not sure this is why leveraged is a bad idea. The down days are made up during uptrends when the 3x ETF returns MORE than 3x because of compounding.

Decay I think refers to something (which I admitedely don't understand) about having to buy more stocks at the end of the day in up markets to maintain 3x exposure. When the market goes up a bunch in a day, the 3x ETF naturally loses it 3x exposure.

I think I may have a higher risk tolerance then normal because i have relatively low living expenses and if I my portfolio goes down 60% im okay with it. With this leveraged ETF strategy, if the market goes down another 30% a 3x levaraged ETF would lose around 60-70% of its value (it would be less then 90% because of daily re-balancing) I think if an investor can stomach the volatility and understand that whatever they put in a 3x Leverage ETF has a good chance of losing 40% of its value in the short term, this investment in 5 years seems like the obvious play for long term return

$100 -> $80 -> +83.33% increase = $146.66 = 1x would be up 46.66% while the 3x hasn't gained any at all. So how much of an increase would it need to be to surpass the 1x fund then?

DCA seems to be a bad idea in such cases. You just said that we're going to count on a sharp uptick within 5 years. DCA will mean you aren't locking in the low prices when they're available. If you're going to gamble with leverage, you have to lock in the low price while they're here.

To my luck, I am currently based in Switzerland where ""non professional"" investors do not pay any capital gains taxes

gzhk5eu,"The most a triple leveraged (index) fund can drop in one day is 60%, since trading will be halted for the day after a 20% drop in the index. With daily rebalancing, the following day you can again only lose, at most, 60% of the remaining value before trading halts. The means on day 1 your portfolio will be worth 40% of the day before; day 2, 16%; day 3, 6.4%; and so on.

If you’re buying a leveraged index ETF, you don’t need to worry about it going to 0. There will be daily rebalancing, and reverse splits, that prevent that from occurring.

That being said, there is very high risk with these ETFs. I like to imagine it as being (3x) long the index, while also being short (non-leveraged) volatility. If volatility spikes while prices increase, the ETF value will increase, since the 3x long “outweighs” the 1x “short volatility”. If volatility spikes while price remains constant or decreases, you lose money from both your 3x long and 1x “short volatility” position. This of course isn’t perfectly accurate and mainly just an approximation, but it helps get the point across, to me at least.

So, think of it this way: would you hold a position that is 3x long QQQ or SPY, and 1x short VIX? If not, don’t hold TQQQ or UPRO without a hedge. There’s been lots of discussion on various forums about viable strategies to hold 3x leveraged funds, and being long bonds as 40-60% of your portfolio with the remainder dedicated to 3x leveraged funds seems to be the most stable over time. There’s still risk involved of course.

If you’re planning on going all-in on 3x leveraged ETFs, be prepared to lose 60% of your portfolio every day during a black swan event. If that is an acceptable risk and you’re bullish on the index, then take it. If not, consider a small position and/or hedging the position with appropriate products (long volatility with rebalancing? bonds? metals? many possibilities here).

The key with these leveraged ETFs, from my experience, is timing the market. Everyone who has failed will tell you it’s impossible, and everyone who has succeeded will tell you that you just need to pay attention to the right things. Personally, I think it’s all bullshit and they got lucky, but to each their own. If you’re going to hold leveraged ETFs, be prepared to sell on the slightest hint of a bad time, and at the very least set up stop loss orders to minimize your suffering in the event of a crash. 

Disclaimer: currently long TQQQ and UPRO as a not-insignificant portion of my portfolio. My hedging methods are currently mostly untested (since both my TQQQ and UPRO positions are green), so I’ve given some generic hedging advice above. Take it with a grain of salt.

Another note, assuming you hold both UPRO and TQQQ, exclusively: a 20% drop in SPY causes a trading halt until the following day, *market-wide*, whereas a 20% drop in QQQ caused a trading halt until the following day *for QQQ*, to the best of my knowledge. If, for some reason, SPY hits -20% in one day before QQQ does, trading on QQQ (and TQQQ) will halt till the following day, meaning your portfolio will drop by *less* than 60%. Likewise, if QQQ drops -20% in a day, trading will be halted, while SPY may not drop that much, again resulting in a less than 60% loss of your portfolio.",1622012826,23,investing,nl9l9d,/r/investing/comments/nl9l9d/buying_and_holding_leveraged_etfs/gzhk5eu/

* Levered Share: $10 \* (1+20%) = $12

Day 2: Index declines by 10%

gzkc5gs,"I made another comment correcting the above - specifically, that QQQ *can* theoretically fall more than 20% in one day. The following will apply only to SPY/UPRO.

Yes, 60% is the (target) daily max loss. The circuit break on SPY will halt *all* trading for the day at -20%, and UPRO will therefore halt at (around) -60%. This is partially the job of market makers, to find inefficiencies in the market and correct/exploit them. If SPY is trading at -15% DoD, and UPRO is trading below -45% DoD, there should exist sufficient buying pressure from market makers and other institutions to move the price closer to the true value of the ETFs holdings. This may not be exactly -45% (since UPRO’s holdings for the day may not be *exactly* tracking 3x SPY), but it should be close.

Note, however, that I stated *daily* max loss. UPRO should halt somewhere around -60%. Normally, it would be rebalanced at the end of the day; however, if the markets of its holdings are halted, it cannot be rebalanced, meaning you might be exposed to the *previous day’s* leverage the following day, leading to a “UPRO-to-0” scenario if the next day opens below -33% (relative to the previous-day’s open).

gzk5db0,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_curb?wprov=sfti1

It would appear as though I was partially mistaken. I will likely update my strategy because of this. What actually occurs to any security in S&P 500, Russel 1000, or QQQ is any price movement of greater than 10% of the last day’s close results in a 15-minute halt. So the actual advice should be as follows:

In the occurrence of a black swan event, QQQ can only drop by, at most 10% every 15 minutes. A drop of 10% is highly likely, but not guaranteed, to correspond to a drop of at least 7% on S&P, triggering a market-wide halt. If not, the halt of all QQQ-listed securities (for 15 minutes) will likely result in the bid-ask of QQQ to become quite wide due to the difficultly of price discovery while all of their assets aren’t trading. This corresponds to a 30% drop in TQQQ before a temporary halt occurs.

So it is theoretically possible for TQQQ to drop more than 60% in one day. It would require that all of its holdings *not in the S&P 500* drop more than 20% in one day. Due to how many stocks are listed in both, you would need a pretty severe drop in the others (with those listed in both dropping <20%) for QQQ to drop >20% while S&P drops <20%.

So, TL;DR: it is possible for TQQQ to drop more than 60% in one day; however, it requires S&P 500 to drop less than 20% while the few (relatively) insignificant holdings of QQQ to drop significantly more than 20%. TQQQ should also not drop more than 30% in a short period of time without all of its holdings halted; price discovery at -30% will be difficult, but it should be reasonable to come up with a strategy to sell as a stop-loss just before a 30% drawdown.

Edit: and yes, I would also recommend UPRO from a risk perspective; however, QQQ has historically performed better than SPY, so depending on risk tolerance (and hedging strategies), it may still be beneficial to consider TQQQ over UPRO, at least for a portion of one’s triple-leveraged portfolio.",1622061825,2,investing,nl9l9d,/r/investing/comments/nl9l9d/buying_and_holding_leveraged_etfs/gzk5db0/

There have been studies which says that leverage is good for when you're young and accumulating. See Ben Felix video here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll3TCEz4g1k

Lastly Bridgewater & Ray Dalio's All-Weather portfolio uses risk parity and leverage it up with futures.

There are various retails funds like PSLDX and NTSX which does the leveraging for you.",1580079926,36,investing,eue4x3,/r/investing/comments/eue4x3/why_not_have_a_big_chunk_in_leveraged_etfs/ffoofzz/

Also read about ""risk parity"" and how they work. AQR has many great articles on the subject.

It can work. But it is risky. They look great the last 10 years, the longest bull market. Leveraged ETFs will suffer a lot if there are big drops in a short time, and markets tend to drop a lot quickly. 2 years of negative return, and you will likely be significantly below unlevered portfolio. They also suffer in sideway (or even a slightly positive) markets from fees, cost of leverage and daily compounding which can hurt in sideways market. In contrast, they do well in a steadily rising market. 15+ years isn't enough of a timeline because UPRO and SSO can drop more than 50%+ in their max drawdowns, and take years to come back to original principal. I don't know anyone who wouldn't rethink their strategy after losing 50% of principal. Tracking error is another issue whereby the fund you purchase doesn't track correctly. Not sure how well they track, but at a portfolio level, this will become an issue as daily rebalancing is not practical for most investors.

That said, there is a lot to be said for utilizing leverage to construct a more diversified portfolio. The link above utilizes TMF (3x LT treasury). Despite the title of that thread, it's certainly not anything close to ""risk-parity."" When you construct a portfolio with 3x S&P500 and 3x LT Treasury, you are betting that stocks will go up and rates go lower, and the opposite not happen. Should inflation come back (leading to increase in rates), this strategy can seriously backfire. After the last 10 years, many believe that equity valuations are quite high, and expect future equity returns to be subpar. If you believe this, leveraging equity may not make sense. I have no answers to this one, but also important is the relationship between equity and bonds going forward, particularly given the low global interest rate environment we are in today.

It's also important to understand that you should be looking at leverage from the portfolio perspective. In short, it doesn't matter if you obtain 200% leverage from SSO, from credit card or mortgage, from futures, etc. The net result in theory is identical regardless of where leverage comes from, but in practice, collateral requirements, borrowing terms, margin call, and all other important technicalities are different. For example, it wouldn't make sense to take a loan from a high APR credit card vs. futures market where you can obtain low cost leverage. Execution matters in this strategy. Another consequence is that - if you hold cash and SSO - it's akin to delevering from 2.0x leverage. It's not a hands-off strategy, as you need to rebalance to keep your portfolio-level leverage in check.

I also don't think the right amount of leverage is 300%. The right amount of leverage would depend on the actual portfolio, and we can only say so in hindsight.",1580079955,20,investing,eue4x3,/r/investing/comments/eue4x3/why_not_have_a_big_chunk_in_leveraged_etfs/ffooizk/

h2n5kl5,"One thing to watch out for:

> Take, for example, an index that begins at 100 and a 2X fund based on that index that also starts at 100. In a first trading period (for example, a day), the index rises 10% to 110. The 2X fund will then rise 20% to 120. The index then drops back to 100 (a drop of 9.09%), so that it is now even. The drop in the 2X fund will be 18.18% (2*9.09). But 18.18% of 120 is 21.82.

1) Dummy THICC expense ratio. 


2) It will underperform in periods of high volatility. There are spans of time when BOTH TQQQ and SQQQ are down. This is due to ""beta slippage"" (that's the way I refer to it, some places will refer to it as ""Volatility decay"". However in low volatility environment, like this last bull run, this beta slippage can actually compound gains. :)


3) large draw downs can force the fund to liquidate. Duringr March, there were rumblings that the the fund was dealing with some liquidity issues and liquidation was on the table for TQQQ. What would happen in this case? Your shares (units) of TQQQ would be redeemed and your losses would be locked in. So in this scenario you can't just hold until things get better.

I thought about this too. Maybe the replies of daily reseting, and larger % changes making it harder to recover from longer downswings doesn't help fully see why a leveraged wouldn't outperform over 20 years. 

I'm no data visualizer, so this is just a quick and dirty graph, but basically, going back to May 2007 and plotting the daily changes in the SP500 vs. a 2x, 3x, 4x, and 5x leveraged SP500 to the present day shows that a 2x barellllly beats the market while a 3x lags behind and 4x and 5x never recover from the 2008 recession. 

I myself still need a bit of convincing though, because this comparison goes through 2 recessions. If you invested in 2009 (could try graphing it yourself), the leveraged SP500s do perform MUCH better (even accounting for the dip this March). So yes, it is risky to invest in leverages and hold long term. 2 extreme drops in \~10 years will cause you to perform worse than the market. You can mayyyyyybe survive 1 extreme drop. I could see holding a 3x as part of a portfolio, but nothing huge.

Note: This does NOT account for the larger expense ratio the leveraged ETFs have. That will also eat into the gains and make losses harder to recover from.",1591056880,3,investing,guve7r,/r/investing/comments/guve7r/why_should_you_not_hold_tqqq_over_the_long_run/fskzj7y/

dit3de0,"I took January 11, 1973 as the start date, as it was the highest the S&P 500 ever was in the 1970s. I start out with 100 USD in each of the funds. Two scenarios: one with no additional investment, the other with additional 100 USD every first trading day of January and July.

The ones with no additional investment ended up at 2,026.03 USD (1x), 10,791.93 USD (2x), and 14,056.13 USD (3x). The ones with additional investment ended up at 80,062.09 USD (1x), 445,068.00 USD (2x), and 819,177.10 USD (3x). 

During the market bottom of March 9, 2009, the 2x leveraged fund was at a significantly higher level than the 3x leveraged fund in both scenarios, but the regular fund was either slightly (w/o reinvestment) or significantly (w/ reinvestment) behind the 3x leveraged fund.

As for a new slowdown, I think the backtesting that starts in 2000 already shows what can be expected if there is a second drop – eventually, the more leveraged funds start performing better (if you continue investing), but it depends on the proportion of your regular investment vs. the funds you have at that moment. 

I'm not sure how to simulate another drop that is the same in magnitude as the 2007–2009 bear market, but has different daily movements. I once tried to just copy the daily movements from 2007 peak to present day and add it to the funds with the 2007 start date. 

I think in the end all of those funds were exactly twice as high as they were after one such cycle, which makes sense mathematically, but doesn't give me much additional insight.

I have some concerns about your points.  

>Too volatile since returns are based on 3x daily returns, not 3x annual returns, which can lead to losses (assuming we are using a 3x ETF)

The volatility is really two issues. First, if you leveerage 2-3x, your risk is 2-3x. 2-3x the S&P is a *lot* of risk. Be prepared for 90% drawdowns. Most people can't handle that amount of risk.  

Second is the compounding effect. It matters but more diversified funds with reasonable amounts of leverage only lose a few percentage points on average. See [backtest](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/alux79/leveraged_sp_etf_backtest_with_daily_and_monthly/). Higher levels of leverage and a more volatile underlying will really ramp up the losses.  

Additionally, any chart that doesn't contain the full 2008 crash is not going to give you a good picture of the risks. Make sure you look at funds that started before then.  

>SPXL vs. S&P 8x normal returns  

You mean also 3x? Minus fees and financing costs (not included in the expense ratio).  
I guess it's a matter of semantics but I would say the leverage doesn't 'cancel' the fees since you're already paying a 'cost' of proportionally higher risk. But the 1% expense ratio is not huge when compared to the potential excess return.  

>Since our stock market is consistent in not giving extremely long periods of losses, can't we assume that eventually, it will grow back regaining your losses and much more?  

You can make a reasonable bet but not assume. Our market outperformed most other countries. I don't think it's a good idea to expect that will always be the case. It's better to err on the side of caution. If you take a look at Kelly criterion betting you'll see that the dropoff is steeper for overbetting compared to underbetting.",1571972319,5,investing,dmq4l3,/r/investing/comments/dmq4l3/how_do_you_feel_about_leveraged_etfs/f546bba/

How the leverage is done is important, though:

> Another approach to gain leverage is to buy index option contracts that are well in the
money. For example, a two-year call option with a strike price of 50 on an index at 100
will cost something close to 50. Thus for $50, the investor can buy exposure to $100 of
the index return. We show below that the implied cost of such 2:1 leverage is quite low

strategy practical in current markets.",1578854746,136,investing,enr9xg,/r/investing/comments/enr9xg/yale_economists_argue_that_the_most_financially/fe4130d/

fe4ndpw,"I personally follow this strategy. So far it’s been easy (stocks always go up!) but before I implemented it I went and back tested around 2008 and found it would have been painful but tolerable. My max draw down would have been about 60% but it recovered within a year. Even a 1987 or 1929 like event would be livable as long as you sell off on the way down and buy back in on the way up.

I modeled all the transaction fees from my broker and if I sell off whenever my leverage gets above 2.1 and buy back in whenever it gets below 1.9 the risk of getting a margin call is minimal and the transaction fees aren’t that bad. It seems a little counter intuitive because you end up selling low and buying high but as long as the market is positive long term it works out.

The real risk is if interest rates go up significantly during a downturn but as long as the Fed keeps doing their thing I view that as acceptable.

I’m also considering bracketing my position by selling a call above the expected movement over a month and buying a put at my rebalance price. This would minimize my pain in a serious downturn and have only limited impact on my upside.

fe46n6r,"I agree with the article. 

Leverage, when applied correctly can greatly shape the form of ones return. An example is running TQQQ/TECL in a portfolio. These have incredible CAGRs, but come at the trade off of incredible drawdowns. 

The human element is what prevents people from taking on leverage. Many people fixate on one “silver bullet” and so they try out a product like TQQQ. However, when that product starts to drop in value, our minds attempt to shy away from the loss and we end up selling at the worst possible time. 

Risk tolerance is captured at an individual level and no two investors will feel the same. I personally enjoy and continue to use leverage in my strategies. I would say that if you’re young and have the ability to generate new capital (to keep infusing your portfolio), then leverage may be worth looking into.

The thing that folks tend to forget with leverage is that even if you happen to be unlucky and get a 50% drawdown in a year, your portfolio likely still has more money in it than if you simply invested in the index.

To prove this, consider UPRO vs VTI. UPRO is leveraged 3x.

https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2019&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=false&reinvestDividends=true&benchmark=VFINX&symbol1=UPRO&allocation1_1=100


Consider that a $10,000 investment in UPRO turns into $171,000, while that same investment (non leveraged) only turns into $35,000 if using just VTI. 

Now, if the index dropped 50% over the course of the next year, that $35,000 in VTI would be reduced to $17,500. Whereas, your UPRO would be reduced as well, but it likely would still end up at a higher dollar figure than the VTI investor (with UPRO, you will only get “wiped out” if the S&P experiences a 34%++ drop in one single day... which is highly unlikely to say the least). This is due to the daily leverage reset on UPRO. 

As with anything, do your due diligence before jumping in. Read the prospectuses of the funds. Understand  the risks and trade offs.",1578856252,26,investing,enr9xg,/r/investing/comments/enr9xg/yale_economists_argue_that_the_most_financially/fe46n6r/

The first is their retrospective use of the US market as the basis for their thinking. This is the very most successful of the hundreds of markets active over the relevant time. This represents a massive **hindsight bias**. Who can claim with confidence to pick the most successful market over the next 50 years?

Second leverage increases your risk of being wiped out. Anyone employing significant leverage across the great depression would have been wiped out. [They claim otherwise but this is because they ignore margin calls and assume you can easily adjust your holdings on the way down.] The reality is that such a person would have exited the market probably for many years, as did most people at the time. They did not have the data from the future to show that that was a bad idea.

Third it is meaningless to talk about average returns. What matters is the distribution. If you are wiped out and there is high unemployment you are up the creek. It does not matter that in an alternate universe you might have been able to buy an extra Ferrari.

Having said that I think there is some merit in young people using leverage, provided they are confident that they will remain employed in a downturn and thus able to replenish the coffers.

fe61nhj,"SSO is the ticker symbol for a daily-leveraged Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). Specifically (ignoring fees), SSO returns 2 times the daily return of the S&P 500 index (which is tracked by ETFs such as SPY, VOO). So if SPY goes up 1% for the day, SSO goes up 2%. The same goes for negative returns, of course.



Some ~~FOOLS~~ conservative people think that buying and holding *daily*-leveraged ETFs is foolish, because your money will gradually decay away due to ""beta slippage"" (which is just fancy jargon used to denote geometric compounding, as far as I can surmise). Those people might be right, when it comes to leveraged commodities: If an underlying asset goes up 10% one day, and falls 10% the next day, then an investment in that asset would have lost 1% cumulatively (0.9 * 1.1 = 0.99), whereas the leveraged fund would have lost 4% (0.8 * 1.2 = 0.96).

This argument could apply to *all* risky investments though, leveraged or not. What it fails to account for is long term price drift. The S&P tends to grow in the long run (that's why it's viewed as a smart investment). So while SSO & UPRO (3x daily leverage) magnify the random day-to-day fluctuations in SPY, they can also magnify and compound its long-term upwards drift. There still is such a thing as too much leverage though; it's sort of a question of how the underlying asset's expected daily return compares with it's variance, and your personal risk tolerance.



Last thing: leveraged ETFs are distinct from margin investing, which I believe is what OPs link actually referred to. The idea there is that you take out a loan on the assets in your portfolio, which you can use to invest more. If the return on your investments is greater than the interest rate of the loan (which can vary widely by brokerage btw), then you've made money by ""leveraging"" your portfolio - increasing your money's exposure to the market. This can be risky, of course, but in some sense that's kind of the point.

So if you look at a chart of SSO, that is exactly what you would have gotten net of fees if you'd have reinvested all the dividends.  SSO would have doubled the return of VTI.

If the next crash affected the funds the same way, SSO would be even quicker to catch up because it's already ahead.

However, it's a mistake to think that just because these funds survived 2008 that they will definitely survive 2020 (or whenever the next crash occurs).  Every stock market crash is different.  XIV is a good example of a fund that blew up overnight because of unheard of spike in volatility.  It could easily happen that a leveraged fund goes to $0, in which case there is no recovering except by continuing to dollar cost average.

The worst thing you can do is invest in a leveraged fund through a crash and ride the market 3x down but then get cold feet and switch to cash or a non-leveraged fund as the market recovers.  So you have to know yourself and what you'd do if you suddenly lost -80%. Would you panic or give up?  In that case, best to stay away from the start.

fe4dusi,"I think that your perception is shared amongst many. People will look for confirmation of that perception and typically circle back to the leveraged silver ETF (which went down and still hasn’t recovered iirc). They then apply that logic to all leveraged ETFs (ergo, if silver, a metal, went down and didn’t recover then the same must be true for every other leveraged instrument).

I too have read plenty of articles that support your position, so I think the mentality is valid and relevant. Unfortunately though, there have been very few “real life” examples of people that have run leverage indexes for an extended period of time. To be fair, some brokerages didn’t let you even trade things like UPRO until recently. 

Time will tell if running a leverage index makes sense. At the time of this writing, it has been successful. There’s also a guy on bogleheads who wrote an experiment running leveraged UPRO and TMF.  He’s almost doubled his money by now (google HEDGEFUNDIEs experiment ). That thread solicited thousands of responses from many different facets of the investing community.

Loss aversion can be real. UPRO may not meet your investment criteria, as the drawdowns are tough. In the current market lifecycle, neither one of us can deny the outperformance of UPRO. Does this mean that it will continue to outperform? Who knows. It’s up over $130,000 compared to the same investment and same time frame in VTI. 

Ultimately, we have to pick investments that match our strategies and our goals. We both want our investments to do well and increase in value; that’s why we’re here.

>Doesn't SSO lose some money every day because of rebalanceing?

This is a good question, and to be honest I'm not an expert on this stuff (just a grad student in a natural science lol), but I think the answer is yes. At least part of it is given by the fund's expense ratio (0.9% in the case of SSO), but it looks like there are other fees incurred in achieving the desired leverage, which appears to be accomplished by a combination of actual stock holdings and derivatives (swaps and futures, judging from [the description of UPRO here.](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=272007) That post is also a very interesting read btw).

Finally, because leveraged funds hold less of the underlying stocks, the dividends are pretty small. 1 share of SSO in December (worth ~150 USD) netted me a whopping 27 cent dividend. That's kind of a good thing if you're investing in a taxable account though; realizing gains can really dampen your growth rate.",1578985208,1,investing,enr9xg,/r/investing/comments/enr9xg/yale_economists_argue_that_the_most_financially/fecukql/

fe80uuj,"**Long-Term Capital Management**

Long-Term Capital Management L.P. (LTCM) was a hedge fund management firm based in Greenwich, Connecticut that used absolute-return trading strategies combined with high financial leverage. LTCM was founded in 1994 by John W. Meriwether, the former vice-chairman and head of bond trading at Salomon Brothers. Members of LTCM's board of directors included Myron S. Scholes and Robert C. Merton, who shared the 1997 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for a ""new method to determine the value of derivatives"".Initially successful with annualized return of over 21% (after fees) in its first year, 43% in the second year and 41% in the third year, in 1998 it lost $4.6 billion in less than four months following the 1997 Asian financial crisis and 1998 Russian financial crisis. The firm's master hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Portfolio L.P., collapsed in the late 1990s, leading to an agreement on September 23, 1998, among 14 financial institutions—which included Bankers Trust, Barclays, Chase Manhattan Bank, Crédit Agricole, Credit Suisse First Boston, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Paribas, Salomon Smith Barney, Société Générale, and UBS—for a $3.6 billion recapitalization (bailout) under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.

The market return over the last 5 years has nothing to do with a management fee. And in case you're under the absolutely retarded belief that the 1% fee covers the interest expense borne by the fund, let me point out that it does not. You are still paying the borrowing cost in addition to the management fee.

Since the original comparison was buying SPY options vs SPXL, allow me to reiterate that SPY options cost less in expenses than SPXL does, so whatever fantastic return of SPXL you want to come back with SPY options will always have the higher return.

I think where you guys keep getting cross-wise is that everyone is saying it’s not worth 1% to avoid having to buy your own options. 

Buying options is relatively easy if you know what you’re doing. You’re advocating to just pay the managers of SPXL 1%, instead of buying your own options. What people are saying is that that is a bad value. Theoretically, if you managed your own option strategy you would beat SPXL.

d3i61qc,"What you call ""decay"" is going to have a much larger impact than what you forecast, especially if the market is volatile along the way.

Leveraged ETF are a bet on a unidirectional movement, so they are also a bet on low volatility. Returns have to go consistently one way otherwise you will not outperform the underlying over the long term.

On top of that they have large fees. To do what you want to accomplish, I think it would make more sense to leverage yourself (borrow to buy the 1x index ETF) as long as you get the best possible interest rates and you are prudent enough with margin.

d3i4bqz,"""Example 1 ""bullish"": Over a 20 year period, the market goes up 150% (irrespective of inflation). Spxl will go up something like 400%? Should be like 450 but taking some arbitrary amount off for decay and expense.""

You're probably underestimating beta-slippage

Super simplified example:
underlying and 3x both start at $1000.
day 1, underlying goes up 20%, 3x increases 60%: $1200 vs $1600.
day 2, underlying drops 15%, 3x drops 45%: $1020 vs $880.

Repeat this two day gain/loss for a month, at the end the underlying will have increased around 35% (pretty good month!) while the 3x leveraged will have decreased 85% (not so good!).

This type of scenario is more applicable to why you shouldn't hold stuff like $UWTI for long periods, SPX isn't nearly that volatile, but decay is still a big problem. Running some quick numbers in Excel, the S&P 500 is up around 63% over the last 10 years, but a 3x position over that same time period is only up around 15%.

Take a look at a chart comparing SPX vs SSO (all you can use is a 10 year period, but that's about as far back as I can find a leveraged ETF that existed before 2007), as an example. SSO: 72.03%, SPX: 61.24%. This is for a 2x leveraged ETF. While I agree it is still positive, I think the following needs to be kept in mind:

1) Your decay estimates may be conservative.

2) While an excellent investment after a major correction, you need to have a high level of conviction that growth is the expectation in the near term if you are investing now. If you start the chart right on Oct 2007, you would only have caught back up to the index (and since then, basically matched it) in the last year.",1464119964,2,investing,4kvd33,/r/investing/comments/4kvd33/leveraged_etf_still_a_bad_idea/d3i4vgs/

If you were looking to leverage up an SPX bet, wouldn't it make more sense to buy an SPX leap option with a 75 delta. You get about 6-8x leverage and your downside is limited to the premium paid. The time decay is minimal and you'd get some protection if the spx turns down because vol would rise. you cold roll them up or out on the way up (if in fact the spx does rise). you might write regular 1 sd calls to gain some income, offset theta decay,  and protect a bit more on the downside. 

at a 75 delta, each contract controls the equiv of 75 shares, so you can calculate your exposure. Does that make sense?",1464156881,2,investing,4kvd33,/r/investing/comments/4kvd33/leveraged_etf_still_a_bad_idea/d3irzpu/

Take a look at SSO (2x leverage) ...  SPY has provided a higher total return since the inception of SSO (2006), and needless to say, with far less volatility.  But if, for instance, one had a 60/40 mix of SSO/TLT or SSO/IEF--or even leveraged up on both sides with: SSO/UST--and rebalanced annually, the risk-adjusted returns start to make a lot of sense (and outperform SPY by quite a bit).

Using the same above scenario above but this time you own the leveraged product. Oil went from 35 to 25 to 35 across multiple days. Each day or defined period the product rebalances itself to the index. Instead of having the same account value. You've lost money. 

For every 1 dollar decrease in the index you need a sizeable increase beyond 1 dollar to not lose money.

fs0mrvu,"The point of that example was a 10% hit in the underlying asset is a lot more devastating if you're holding the leveraged version of that asset. You have more you have more loss you have to recover from. Obviously a loss in any asset of equivalent percentage is proportionally worse than a gain of that percentage which is why the higher the leverage the bigger the loss. What you linked literally gives the exact example I described with different numbers.

dp5edf3,"> everybody on this post seem to be saying that it doesn't turn out the way it looks, and that doesn't make sense to me.

You're correct. The performance is real *if* you stayed invested through the entire period. This means you didn't sell when it went down almost 50% in 2009. Or when it went down almost 40% in 2010. Or the 50% drawdown in 2011 that left you right at the same returns as a normal 1x SP500 that only had drawdowns of 10-18% during the same period. You wouldn't really see any headway until volatility dropped and the bull market stabilized some in 2012. During that time we had no idea if the crises was over or if we were going back down 50% again which would have essentially wiped out the 3X fund. It would have taken very serious conviction to put all your money in a 3x fund and leave it there. 

Leverage can turn a good investment into a lottery ticket. The higher the leverage the more binary the outcome and the more dependent you are on lucky timing of your investment.

But here's some critically important perspective... 3x leveraged ETFs do NOT follow their parent ETF at a perfect 3x multiplier for the year. They follow each *DAY* at a 3x multiplier.

Let's say you start with $100 in both QQQ and TQQQ. Today QQQ goes down 20%, and TQQQ goes down 60%. 
 And then tomorrow QQQ goes back up 20%, and TQQQ goes up 60%.

QQQ ended up at $96 (down 4% from starting amount), while TQQQ ended up at $64 (down 36% from starting amount!!).

du6lzeb,"I entered a position in mid january, but still going to hold it out. I looked at the charts for other 3x Leveraged ETFs during 2008. Looks like SPXL and FAS were around and survived complete collapse, which I don't think is what is happening here.

FAS is the best example, given that it's inception was in Nov 2008, and while financials already took a massive hit by that point, there was still another 55% downside from then until March 2009. FAS took something like a 95% hit from that selling, but has still managed to come back. And that is from a complete economic collapse.

SPY in general went down something 25% during that same time period, and SPXL managed to go a little less than 70%, and obviously that produced much greater returns over time since then, even with multiple corrections from '09-'18.

I think point being, unless we're on the verge on a complete economic collapse again then 3x leveraged etfs should be able to weather the storms. basically as long as we don't see indexes drop by 60% or more, and volatility rate remains 50% or lower, then they most likely can come back.

So basically what I did was take 1/3 of the money I was going to invest in QQQ and put it into TQQQ, if the markets get completely obliterated then I still would end up losing less money, though a higher overall percentage of investment obviously. And the only way I'm adding more is if we see a 2007-2008 style crisis, and get confirmation of a turnaround like in 2009.

du54wv3,"So the best question to ask yourself when considering TQQQ, UDOW, or UPRO to QQQ DIA or SPY/VOO/IVV respectively is: how comfortable are you using leverage? If you have 3000$ in your portfolio, would you feel comfortable having 3200$ worth of assets, and paying interest on 200$; this only corresponds to about 6% of your net investment. 

While this approach is not exact, it should give you an example of evaluating the underlying method you are using to evaluate maximum losses.

The second thing to consider is to examine the back testing losses which COULD have occurred if you bought the leveraged version of the particular etf. For example, if you would have bought TQQQ and QQQ 8/14/2015 and held, both etfs would break even on 10/23/2015, though you would be down 3x as much (-23.28% vs -7.55%) holding TQQQ.

The last thing to consider is the prospectus of the leveraged etfs and the change in interest rates. Are there provisions in the leveraged fund that could cause it to be delisted?

frabry8,"There's a bunch of things to unpack here, but the main thing you are being tricked by is that the past 10 years have been a strong bull market.  

Leverage works up and down.  Look at March's effect on the SPXL and notice that it puts you back to 2016 levels.  Whereas with SPY, it puts you back to 2019 levels.  

And once you get knocked down, it takes longer to make it back because you fell more than an unleveraged fund.  

Another way to see this close-up is just compare the two funds over the past 3 months.  

There are other issues with leveraged ETFs, but the above it the main one if you're considering a buy & hold strategy.  Works fine if the market is fairly consistently moving in the right direction.",1590015927,7,investing,gnkz72,/r/investing/comments/gnkz72/leveraged_etfs/frabry8/
fracnym,"https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/6buq3h/spy_vs_spxl_for_long_term_growth/dhq6kif

Basically, you're relying on a strong bull market. 2010-2020 is basically one of the longest bull markets ever seen...so it's a bit of a cherry picked data point in favour of SPXL. 

That said, it literally says it in the tin - 3X leverage. It's more than doubling down if you are ABSOLUTELY sure the market is going up. If you're wrong (even if the market trades flat), then you get double shafted by leverage on downward moves, plus decay that hurts more when you're down already.",1590016478,3,investing,gnkz72,/r/investing/comments/gnkz72/leveraged_etfs/fracnym/

Using empirical data the leveraged ETFs did fine? Did I miss something?  

Why is buy and hold bad if you just continue to hold through the bad times. The market shuts off at -20% so you can’t get -50% which would lose all of your money.

frahqtp,"Thanks for running the simulations.  Two issues I think I see:

1) I suspect that randomly picking days isn't a fair analysis because during corrections/recessions/depressions, you string together a bunch of down days.  In the dot-com crash, it was 2 years net downwards pressure.  

2) 2x leverage is safer than 3x.  String together 2 weeks of down days and your down to a very small amount to dig out of.

Instead of random dates, it'd be nice to see what a leveraged fund would do from say Jan 1998 to Jan 2004.   That will give you 2 years of bull market, followed by 2 years of bear, followed by the start of a slow recovery.",1590019401,1,investing,gnkz72,/r/investing/comments/gnkz72/leveraged_etfs/frahqtp/

frai4r5,"I ran it for 3x too but the swings were pretty wild. It wasn’t a massive improvement from 2x all things considered. 

I agree one the first point. I did this a bit ago and have been thinking about it. If we assume stocks always recover wouldn’t it be okay to just hold through a crash. Yes you lose more but you’ll gain more too if they recover. If they don’t recover, well then any investor even 1x is pretty screwed, just less so.",1590019618,2,investing,gnkz72,/r/investing/comments/gnkz72/leveraged_etfs/frai4r5/
frak13x,"Well, the two years after the dot-com crash was a 78% drop.  So anything with leverage would have hit zero well before those two years were done.  

As for the ""lose more gain more"" thought, again, it's true if each day was independent, but if your fund is depleted through a few days of leveraged down days, it will take many more days to recover. 

As a simple example let's say you start with $1000, you go through a 20% down day (e.g. Black Monday), and then gain 10% a day.

Day | Unlevered | Levered 3x
---|---|----
1 | 1000 | 1000
2 | 800 | 400
3 | 880 | 520
4 | 968 | 676
5 | 1065 | 879
6 | 1171 | 1142
7 | 1288 | 1930

My math might be off, but it should be good enough to see that it takes an extra day to get back to even.  Yes, if you string together enough up days, it will outpace the unlevered fund, but you run the risk of going to zero if you hit a series of down days, which during a recession, there's more down days than up.",1590020671,2,investing,gnkz72,/r/investing/comments/gnkz72/leveraged_etfs/frak13x/
fralgsi,"No the only way you go to 0 is if you have -50% in one day. If I have 1000 and have 4 straight -20% days in the SP500, I would have 4 straight -40% days in the 2x, and -60% days in the 3x. 

1x = .8^4 = .4096

2x =.6^4 = .1296

3x =.4^4 = .0256 


So yeah the only way your fund is depleted is if you get -50% in a day of the SP500 which can’t happen, or -33% for a 3x. You’ll still have money/shares, but just less of it. 

The SP500 long term return is around 10% a year which seems to bode well for stringing together more up days than down days, especially since I can never go mathematically to 0 due to the -20% SP500 circuit breaker.",1590021463,1,investing,gnkz72,/r/investing/comments/gnkz72/leveraged_etfs/fralgsi/

ewctsik,Index funds no leverage. If you really want leverage trade on margin (borrowed money) you put up your portfolio as collateral. Right now for under 25k IB has a 4% interest rate which isn’t too hard to beat long term. Only problem is margin calls which are triggered by portfolio value dipping to low and they sell off your investments to cover loan. You could play it very safe though with below 1.5x leverage and avoid a margin call.,1565290229,3,investing,cnpybc,/r/investing/comments/cnpybc/is_it_a_bad_idea_to_throw_40k_into_upro/ewctsik/
