What I would do in your shoes:

1. Buy 1 broad market index (F500/F1000/R2000 equivalent) (45%-50%)
2. Buy 1 Growth market index  (45%-50%)
(You can stop here! Or…)
3. Buy 2 high conviction company stocks that make up no more than 10% aggregate of any cash you put in. 

No 3 is simply further indexing on #2. 

You do not need income producing stocks unless you are interested in pursuing a dividend strategy long-term. I would not pursue such a strategy currently.

And about the “crashes not being real” point; that’s just plain wrong. the 2020 covid crash was one of the sharpest drawdowns in market history, with the S&P 500 falling over 33% in just a few weeks. 2022 saw the worst year for stocks in decades, with the Nasdaq dropping \~33% peak to trough; you're right, hardly a walk in the park. And the 2025 tarrif crash wiped trillions off the markets almost overnight on pure policy risk.

If you don’t call those real crashes, then you’re basically rewriting history; They are crashes by definition of the word. Anyone actually invested during those times knows the panic, volatility, and uncertainty were very real. “Reliable growth” is only something you say if you weren’t paying attention, or if you cherry-pick the recovery while ignoring the drawdowns.

I didn’t panic sell & bought all the dips on stocks because I have full conviction in every single one of the underlying companies. That’s exactly why I’ve consistently outperformed. you prejudice my experience while you have no clue how much time I have invested learning about stocks and how much of a passion it is for me. but if anything someone calling this decade “reliable growth” shows they really weren’t paying attention. 3 crashes (by DEFINITION) in 5 years, reliable growth my ass.",1756555948.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n32vqy/hi_freshly_starting_investing_into_stocks_i_need/nbh9js6/

And calling 2020, 2022, and 2025 “blips” is laughable. The 2022 downturn lasted from late 2021 all the way into 2023 before markets fully recovered, almost two years of pain.

2) I have cash on hand for regular expenses 1month? Six months?

2) long term liabilities are in a planned repayment or addressed month to month? Long term costs? (Anything 0% has an investment consideration due to time value of money. $200/month five years ago hopefully represented a larger portion of total income compared to this year's income.)

Six months: high yield savings account, CD specials, Treasury bonds

First, the market isn't cheap by any historical measure. Despite the drop we are really only back to where it was about a year ago. If anything these past 12 months could be considered a bubble and we still have eye-watering P/E ratios in the S+P 500. Even 20 years ago we had a decade where the S+P barely grew (2000-2010) and yet somehow people think that it is always destined to go up and to the right by like 20% a year because it happened 2 years in a row (and promptly gave back 1/2 of those gains). 

Second, those high valuations in many companies are predicated on continued massive growth. We have *no* idea what Trump is going to do with these tariffs, and tbh I don't think he does either.

Why does volatility matter if you are holding long term? Just to feel a little better on down days? 

2020 to today JEPI 71% return. VOO same period 113% just to not have some volatility? It doesn't make sense. It's emotional feel good nonsense. That difference gets gigantic as time goes on, 42% is already huge. Plus paying a higher expense ratio for nothing.

Berkshire Hathaway has never had dividends because they are completely pointless and less efficient. 

The only use of dividends is if you are retired, living off your portfolio, and are too lazy to sell some shares as needed.

They were more useful when you couldn't click a button on your phone to sell a little stock.

It's not theoretically tax inefficient it's literally taxed as normal income at your normal income tax rate. Nothing theoretical about that. Vs long term capital gains tax which is lower. Or better yet not being taxed at all, staying in the stock or fund and continuing to compound.

It's like taking $100 out of your bank account and then sticking $100 back in and feeling like you made $100

Buffett said for shareholders of his own company, or any stock that doesn’t offer a dividend and is a significant holding, there is a way to create your own dividend stream without forcing the permanent and taxable event on all shareholders: Sell a little stock each year.

“Years ago I pointed out you can sell a little piece of Berkshire every year and still end up owning more of it.

Not a single thing I said has anything to do with timing the market. Seems like you didn't read or didn't understand. Math is hard I get it. If you think selling some stock at a rate equal to or less than a dividend (as needed instead of constant) once you are retired will make it burn down to zero, I don't know what to say to that 

Lowering your taxes, living off your day job income when you are young, and then selling tiny bits of stock when you're retired if even needed is a bad strategy? You have social security, possibly a pension, 401k, probably a IRA. All those will begin distribution. After all that you are still short you can sell some. Nothing about that is timing the market.

Just being in something like VOO instead of JEPI you will have exponentially more money after a lifetime. All to avoid some volatility during your working years?

It's like people sitting on cash for years waiting for the big dip. Sure they might make 40% quickly and feel like a genius that made all this extra money but really they missed out on 200%, 300%, 400% etc

Then you die and leave something far larger to your kids. 

Also this guy is 30! He isn't retiring soon, he's adding money every week, and he's making hundreds of thousands a year and you're recommending an income ETF. If 2007 happens he will be buying at a discount. 

Investing strategy changes depending on your age going for low volatility, lower performing, income etfs is the exact opposite of what you should do when you are young.

Anyone who didn't panic sell in 2020-2022 came out ahead. Anyone who had something like VOO instead of JEPI came out ahead so I'm not sure what your point is.

Selling stock is no different than a dividend, that's where the dividend comes from, it doesn't make it go to zero unless you are pulling out too much.

If making your own dividend is timing the market then normal dividends are timing the market. You aren't understanding how dividends work. The fact you said tax on dividends is theoretical is very telling. How is one timing and the other isn't? I guess DCA is also timing the market?

I can break this down for you.

If you had perfectly identical stocks one with a dividend and DRIP turned on one without. 30-40 years later the dividend stock with DRIP will be less and even more significant if you were in a high tax bracket most of your working years.

Once you are retired. Same thing 2 identical stocks one with a dividend one without. Let's say the dividend yield is 4%. The non-dividend stock you sell 4% a year, 20 years later you die. The market value of those 2 positions will be identical 20 years later.

As long as the stock's CAGR is greater than 4% it will NEVER go to zero. If it's less than 4% the dividend stocks share price will decrease and will cause your positions market value to decrease at exactly the same rate as you selling 4% a year. There is no free money it's all coming from the same place.

If you went with a income ETF that underperforms the market the difference will be massive. That's all money not going to the kids.

Now those 4% payments. For the non-dividend stock If it's under $50k a year you pay ZERO in taxes. Under $530k a year only 15% tax.

VS paying taxes on income you didn't need your entire life and then paying even more taxes on it when your retired.

If you read a finance book it will agree with me.

 I never said to switch to dividends when you are older. You're clearly not reading. My point was you shouldn't be concerned about volatility when you aren't needing the money for decades.",1734728864.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hiq21y/every_monday_morning_i_invest_1885_here_is_how_i/m31ga6m/

Adding more risk is meaningless unless it’s compensated risk. Otherwise you’re just decrease risk adjusted returns without increasing expected returns.

Many people assume “growth funds” equal greater returns… that’s a misconception. It’s not even true historically. Value funds have outperformed growth  funds historically. Tech and U.S. stocks don’t fundamentally outperform long-term either. That belief is rooted in recency bias. 

If you’re looking for a more aggressive strategy then overweight areas of the market that are supported theoretically and historically to outperform. This is of course no guarantee to outperform, but it will at least serve to increase compensated risk rather than uncompensated. Fama and French’s 5 factor model provides a great outline for us to follow if we are looking to increase compensated risk. The most common ways to do that are by overweighting the value and size (small caps) factors. Leveraging up a globally diversified portfolio is also a great way to increase compensated risk… this overexposes you to beta which explains 2/3 of historical market returns.",1733005165.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h3mv0s/investing_in_qqqm_smh_and_voog_consolidate/lzs3nky/

One thing for sure: The recent depressed prices allowed cheaper batteries. Would it mean more affordable EVs and increased demand? Would demand exceed supply like it did two years ago? Or would there be always a surplus, like today, keeping prices at the bottom indefinitely? Would cheaper batteries, together with net-zero plans, give way to more BESS installation, resulting in another demand boom? Considering the China Factor I mentioned, it is almost impossible to answer these questions, in my opinion.

Municipal bonds are federally tax free.  But they pay rather low yield as a result.  You need to be in quite a high marginal tax bracket for munis to make sense over investment-grade corporate or even Treasury bonds.  In other words, the amount you are saving by not having the distributions taxed does not make up for the lower yield.  You'd have more net, post-tax money from an A-rated corporate bond even though the distribution is taxed.

Now is a great time to buy up long term corporate or Treasury bond funds.  Look into VCLT and VGLT for example, or even a total bond index fund like BND.

The longer the duration the higher the risk. An example is a long term fund like VGLT has a bond duration of about 20 years (not exact, using as an example), If interest rates drop by 1% that fund's value increases by 20%. If rates rise 1%, that funds value drops 20%. People might buy these long term bond funds for capital gains associated with any future rate changes (and people are buying betting rates will drop). Are capital gains from the bond portion of your portfolio your goal? If your goal is to reduce the portfolio risk you might be better off with a mid term bond fund of says 7 years where the swing would be 7%, not 20%. If your goal is income then bonds can be used another way (build a bond ladder). Be aware bonds can be risky, especially long term bonds.

How much you want in bonds has a lot to do with your draw percentage and your life expectancy.  If your 401k at 65% of assets is 50% fixed income then you have over 32.5% fixed income.  Which likely is plenty, but again this depends on your draw (at 3% it is high, at 5% just about right at 10% it isn't near enough or too much depending on age).

The MTBIX is interesting as that's a NYLife product, I'd be curious how you got in that without having gotten into life insurance or annuities as an investment product elsewhere.

In general, there are 2 things you want your bonds to do that your stocks are worse at.

1. Liquidity -- provide quick money for sudden expenses potentially when stocks are down.
2. Lifestyle -- provide a higher draw now to allow you to spend more safely

You take on two minuses:

1. Longevity -- lowering the return of your portfolio while being able to draw more means you are depleting faster.  You need to make sure the assets last long enough.

2.  Legacy -- because you decrease the performance of your portfolio on average you pass on less.

To counter these two minuses, annuities can help a lot.  They return more which means less in bonds, more in stocks.  Tips can counter inflation.  Higher yielding bonds deplete principal to generate income and pack in extra punch.

So in terms of strategy:

* Draw from stocks in a reasonable way.  Aim for something like dividends + 1%. On higher markets deplete stocks to replenish bonds if needed.  That is you are timing either through rebalancing or bucketing.  Stocks are not a reliable income source at higher draws.
* Have enough liquidity (1-3 years spending) in short-term bond funds or more risky.
   * short term corporates
   * intermediate treasuries -- if you intend to use this to rebalance you will want more than 1-3 years.
   * a distinct account can be up to 30% stock, 70% bonds if you are likely to have it sit a long time.
* Use some combination of high-yield bonds, annuities  and Tips for enhanced spending.  These can often have worse liquidity than stocks they are designed as an income enhancement.  You are canceling out expenses.  Annuities IMHO work the best here.",1717523014.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d828gy/seeking_basic_bond_fund_strategy_advice_for_a/l73fsyq/

I'm not in that position presently.  Pre-retirement I was in a high tax bracket so I guess that's why my former fund manager added these bond funds into my account.

Actually I'm living off HY savings and social security right now, depleting cash before taking anything from investments, and I should be able to continue for another 2 years or so. There's an added benefit for me to keep my taxable income as low as possible right now as I'm getting a senior discount on my property taxes but only if my taxable income stays below a fairly low threshold. Of course I'll lose this benny eventually once my savings are dry, but for now it's significant enough to maintain it if I can, not to mention the federal tax benefit I get from having low income. And therein lies the rub with these bond funds, as (if I understand correctly) if I were to liquidate them to use elsewhere, their sale would be considered income and likely (given the amounts) push my income way over the prop tax threshold (they count non-taxable income as still income).

If you expecting your income to really rise in the future you may want to take it all out now.

Otherwise you may just want to take it out slowly (after you pay off the credit cards, which you definitely should do), like a 10th of a year at a time and let the gains accumulate mostly tax free in that account.

You can do an inkind transfer to Vanguard or Fidelity. Ask the Edward Jones rep about fees for this. If they recommend active funds for you, run.

What I would do is keep the money in VT in the retirement account and slowly shift/sell the money in that inherited IRA into a Roth IRA or a 401k to minimize taxes on future gains. You can also invest in education accounts for your kids.

If you find a company that you really believe in and you think it has more growth potential at the price it is trading at, a smart investor would sell the ""overvalued"" stock and buy the undervalued one. A company is only ""overvalued"" relative to other companies, it is subjective and you have to learn how to value a company based on its fundamentals and your own opinions.

There are a lot of factors that determine when you should do this. For example, if you're not very active in the market, you should only buy companies that you are absolutely confident in holding for the long term. If you are more active, you can rebalance your portfolio more often, but there is a very fine line between trading and investing. If you're not a trader, and you don't aspire to be, you should not be moving your positions around too often.

I personally think NVDA is a great company and that it has more growth to come, but I strongly believe that you can't go wrong taking profits at these prices as long as you are moving the money into something you think is a better value. When I sell a company, I don't like to sell my entire position as it lets me keep an eye on the price and help me know when I should add to it (or sell more). I only ever buy companies in my investment account that I'm okay with holding for a long time, so this approach works well for me.

Good luck.",1709874010.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b93ybd/nvidia_nvda_stock_wait_or_sell/ktvjejk/

Semiconductors,Investing,1ajx9sd,Still Obsessed with Chip Makers,kp7taoz,"The term 'priced in' is nonsense. If every bit of information was priced in, prices would never change. 

I commented elsewhere in this thread, but the chip space is so complex and the demand is growing so rapidly, that there are certain companies that are all but guaranteed to benefit and see increased revenue for the foreseeable future simply because they are the only company in the entire market. Manufacturing is insanely capital intensive and relies on decades of expertise, and as chips become increasingly complex the companies that make them have a widening moat rather than a shrinking one. Bullish on ASML, TSM, and to a lesser extent INTC. 

And I don't buy that the essential nature of these companies is 'priced in' even if everyone has been talking about their importance for years. People do not realize how foundational these handful of players are to the entire future of technology. 

I can get not stock picking, but it's also completely valid to take on a little more risk when you have a long term investment horizon.

The Canon technology is not remotely as refined and the entire manufacturing environment of advanced chips has been built around ASML for decades now. To meaningfully break into the space will take decades. That's assuming that Canon has genuinely refined the technology to be more economical. If it's slower, produces more errors, and requires more maintenance than ASMLs machines, it is not necessarily going to be more cost effective. Plus the EUV lithography machines ASML already has on the market can produce chips just as complex and dense as the Canon machine, which hasn't even been deployed yet.

Semiconductors,Investing,xa76bi,Let's talk about the semiconductor industry,ivgbrx9,"The opposite is happening though, Intel does need to get their shit together but they have committed to building more foundries for advanced chip production in the US. I'm invested in both, but personally I think Intel is in a position where it cannot fail and is likely to come back in a big way. With the dividend and the price it has been at recently, I think its all upside. They run one of the few fab operations in the US, and they produce and sell their own chips. This differentiates them from TSM, NVDA, and AMD. AMD and NVDA outsource production to TSM, and TSM solely produces semiconductors. AMD and NVDA then use those in their chips - INTC produces their own semis and their own chips. 

They are also one of the very few companies in the world that can produce the most advanced chips, and they have the capacity and funds to commit to both the research and production of them. Sure they're behind TSM, but so is essentially everyone, and with the weight of the DoD I don't see the U.S. govt. ever allowing INTL to flounder - it would be a national security threat. More than that, INTL has partnerships with DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. 

My time horizon is very long term, 30+ years. I think any semiconductor industry stock is going to explode in that timeframe. Consumer demand for electronics, and increasingly complex electronics, is not going anywhere.

Current valuations are inflated. 

If you aren't reinvesting the vast majority of your profits then someone will catch up and pass you - the industry moves that fast. 3-5 years of execution errors or insufficient R&D and your company can be finished.

It's highly cyclic, and very exposed to the business cycle. Margins are tight enough relative to capital costs that unused capacity means big losses. Either that means oligopolies where companies under-build capacity to keep stable/high prices or the situation with NAND/etc. where the market gets flooded and everyone loses money when demand dips.

As such it isn't an industry that will be able to return much capital to shareholders - certainly not relative to present valuations. Structurally... It's not a good industry to invest in from a capital standpoint. To make good money it's got to be on share price appreciation and top line growth. But present valuations are very momentum driven and speculative. What if the collective market decides the entire industry should be valued like Micron because of the above concerns?

Semiconductors,Investing,wuqa86,Long-Term Investment: Semiconductors vs. Energy,ilcigof,"That’s a great question. The basic problem with it is the either/or exclusionary framing. If data is the new oil of the economy but data centers are highly energy intensive, then can we afford to express this question as a dichotomy? I suggest that intelligent investors should take a more nuanced approach. Why not the best of both industries? Have you considered Tesla for example?

First let me disclose my bias. I am a longterm Moore’s Law investor who looks for sustainable competitive advantage at a reasonable price with excellent managements, values, and track records measured in decades. The “reasonable price” part of the equation is due to the partial fallacy of the cyclicality of the industry. While it’s certainly true that the semi industry has been cyclical, which accounts for a lower PE than its secular growth rate might justify, it is also true that it is becoming less cyclical as the uses for semiconductors has expanded from defense and computers to a wide array of consumer and industrial products in addition to auto, iot, ai, medical etc. Those companies that have been in this industry for decades have mastered the art of survival at the bleeding edge of nanotechnology. Compared to the complexity and engineering challenges of the task of making 5nm chips, the art and science of running a profitable business are almost child’s play to them. They approach their task with an engineer’s precision and ethically balance their responsibilities to customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders and society in a manner that never ceases to amaze me.

I do not have a similar high confidence in the energy sector although I have not studied them quite so deeply. Here is what I have noticed:

1) The renewable energy segment, which arguably might include Tesla, has not been around as long as the semiconductor industry so it has not accumulated similar experience curves or track records. Also barriers to entry are generally much higher in the semi industry.

Battery chemistries are much less mature than silicon. High volume manufacturing with great precision and uniformity while reducing defects and cost is equally important to Elon Musk as it is to Gary Dickerson and the machines that GD’s company makes shape our daily lives to a much greater extent than EM’s Teslas yet few outside his industry even recognize his name…

2) Energy industry profitability may be negatively correlated with semiconductor industry profitability. Periods of oil supply disruption like the oil embargo of the early 1970s or the Russia-Ukraine war today have caused disruptions and contractions to the worldwide economy which simultaneously caused energy shares to skyrocket while leading to semiconductor share prices (if not profits) to stumble. 

3) I could go on but I fear boring you to death…",1661189600.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/wuqa86/longterm_investment_semiconductors_vs_energy/ilcigof/

Semiconductors,Investing,se1nzr,Thematic ETFs are a bad idea,huinpfk,"1 is true though you are talking .3-.4% in most cases.

2 is investor behavior that is not inherent to ETF

3 is the same.

But 2 and 3 still lead to a zero sum game. If VTI holds every stock, and people are all chasing something that is performing worse than VTI, then the sum of everything not in that group has to be performing better.

Now, I guess I can agree with a rough idea of like ""thematic ETF advertise themselves as less risky than stock picking but really it's still stock picking."" I guess I understand that argument, though fundamentally it is also untrue, particularly in risky segments. For instance ICLN overall performance has been terrible the last 6 months, but is better than, say, ENPH has been over that time (this was the first ticker I looked at that I know ICLN holds, I'm sure if I run through I can find some that performed much worse than the ETF even including the fees).

At the end of the day, the argument still boils down to a basic boglehead thing of ""retail investors have no business stock picking, just set and forget and buy and hold - don't worry about cycling, about timing the market, etc. etc."" And yes, thematic ETF fall within this argument. I'm not sure there is a much more compelling argument against them though, other than sure, the fee structure.

None of this changes my point. Every thematic ETF in aggregate cannot, by definition, underperform VTI on any time horizon (including 5 minutes) by more than the fee difference, unless there is some segment within VTI that they are not touching. Therefore, if you think all thematic or segment ETF are going to underperform the market as a whole, then there has to be a counterbalancing segment (the not popular with marketing people or whatever) that would outperform.",1643331007.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/se1nzr/thematic_etfs_are_a_bad_idea/huinpfk/

Once I found out I wasn’t going to lose my job I literally threw all of my money/savings  into stocks and b coin. Since we were stuck at home and still had a job I wasn’t going to need the money for anything else.

I honestly would wait for another deep correction or bear market to do this again. Even then, last year was almost a once in a 10-15 year opportunity. Maybe once in a lifetime, the fed was literally propping up the market where anything you invested in was surely to be a winner. And the government was sending “free” money to people. 

I was paying off debt and investing the rest of those stimulus payments, so I was able to dollar cost average with those monthly amounts. It was almost stupid how easy it was last year.

Semiconductors,Investing,rh0orj,Is borrowing money to invest right now a good idea?,honhxkc,"Yeah,  the answers here are pretty bad 

To answer OP's question the answer is yes it's a good idea,  but probably not for you. The fact that you think you can casually generate 15% returns for years to come means you don't have realistic expectations, and thus are not the kind of person that should be borrowing 

The fact is big companies do this *all the time*, and it's a major thing within real estate. The difference between them and you is that they're in control of what happens with their investments. You're relying on someone else to do perform well, which is fine, but it's an important distinction to make. 

Last thing, it depends on what kind of interest rate you're getting. If you used a mortgage (refinancing, or new mortgage) and have good credit you could be looking at <2.5% interest. Using an amount you feel comfortable losing could be worthwhile because you're borrowing at a very low rate, and if you can afford the extra monthly cost. Putting that in the market could pay off huge.

The CEO in my example didn’t personally borrow $100mm. But put that in perspective. A company borrowing $100mm for acquisition is big - like an Amazon with an asset base exceeding $1.5T. So $100mm is less than 1% of 1% of assets for them.

Apply the same logic to OP. Would you tell him don’t risk borrowing 0.0001% for investment? Sounds pretty conservative and excessively risk averse to me. If his portfolio is $100,000 and he wants to borrow $10 would you look down your nose at him?

The point is, nobody is saying OP should lever to the tits. There are smarter and less-smarter ways of levered investing. Writing it all off as “dumb” and “very stupid” without any more information seems a bit conservative.

Levered investing requires intelligence. You have to structure it right, get the lowest possible rate, term it out correctly, have a way to service interest expense, and not take on too much debt relative to your asset base.

But if you want a chance of outperforming an index fund, you need to narrow it down a bit. The narrower you get, the higher the chance of outperforming (or underperforming) an index.

P.S. consider taking a look at XL Fleet if you have the time, I have almost an equally large position in that as I do PTRA, and it is slated to be added to the Russell here soon. It might have been one of the hardest hit SPACs but seems to have turned back around now thank heavens.

Semiconductors,Investing,m9dmdf,Financial Market Pessimism,grm9laq,"I had this very same conversation with myself in the past while looking at the ceiling before going to sleep. If all went to hell, where to keep my money safe?.

It depends, I'd then say. Are we talking ""Economy goes to hell worldwide"" scenarios? well, you can't eat bills and you can't drink gold, so land, cattle, seeds and tools (weapons too if you are american) :P

If we aren't talking apocalypse, but, say, Tulipmania, 1929, Black Thursday levels of econ-crisis, then I'd say nothing will do, but real state is possibly the best deal (least worst, if that's a thing) since no matter what you do, you have to live somewhere, and if there is a major crisis and loans/mortgages get a hit, people will not be able to buy anymore, so they will absolutely have to rent. Stocks are out of question unless they are blue chips (utility companies, you'll still need to put gas on your car, internet is too big of a thing now, etc etc). If you have to go haywire in the middle of a recession and cut down on everything, you'll cut on spending starting with non essentials. Consumer product producers will take a hit, even giants like AMZN or AAPL (no one needs an Iphone when having to go to food banks). I think we get the idea.

The real question is, are we talking ANOTHER crisis like the ones we use to have every decade or so like a clock, or will this be the first crisis on a world scale on proportions so devastating that nothing on the history books will be comparable? Then we will have to stop talking about what happened in the past and how we dealt with it before (remember what you did in 2008?) and start talking about how bad would that big bang be.

Say the USD devalues itself into the ground. I might be way off on this one, but I think as much as 40% of US debt is in the hands of China. If the USA debased their currency by, say, 50% (or worse, defaulted), could there be a war over payments?. A contagion would be very likely, so if that spreads into competitive devaluations like in the interwar period, we could see some really nightmarish scenarios. At that point, I can only speculate.

There is an old proverb that goes ""if you own 1 gold, you are in trouble with your bank, if you own 100000000 gold, the bank is in trouble with you"". If everybody bankrupts left right and center and nobody repays their debts at once, in what place would that place us? back to bartering?

Semiconductors,Investing,m9dmdf,Financial Market Pessimism,grp3mql,"1) Expensive is a relative term. With fractional shares and margin accounts being a thing, there is no such thing as a stock being “too expensive” from a sheer monetary point of view. 

Low value? Yes. The P/E ratios are at all time highs. 

This is what we call a “speculative economy”, where most money people make ends up coming from speculation assets than actual work. 

It’s not the best thing when looking at gdp per capita, but is still the best solution considering all the automation + globalization going on. 

2) I agree 100%. And for this reason, it is widely believed the Fed will not take the foot off the gas like it did before. Instead, it will likely seek to create an endless number of investment assets to store excess liquidity. 

3) Yep - negative is the only way to go. And encouraging spending is exactly what the Fed wants people to do. Instead of saving in the traditional sense, it seems to be shifting towards encouraging everyone to save through spending on investment assets. 

4) with yields rising, bonds become a decent store of value, especially if yields exceed inflation. 

5) yes. The housing market is the biggest danger to the US economy (again), mainly due to renters being mostly people who were left out of the stock market rise (and all other assets along with it) as they are likely to be paycheck workers who can barely afford month to month living. 

Something will need to get done to stabilize the market (limit investment buying) or a disaster will eventually happen there. 

6) digital currencies will inevitably rise and fall in spectacular fashion. They will increasingly become the prime contributors to rapid booms and busts. 
Thankfully, most busts will not last more than a few weeks / months due to the fed’s modern monetary policy. 

7) precious metals are heavily manipulated and are known to be sold to multiple entities at once through IOUs. 80% of supplies are stored in Bullion banks, who are the prime manipulators. 
If, for whatever reason, there were to be a sudden surge to extract them from the banks, these banks would likely shut their doors and forbid extraction. 

8) agree 

9) a better strategy would be to diversify. A small amount in cash is always a good, but so is having money in various investment assets from different classes (crypto, commodities, stocks, real estate and others)

All exclusive content will mean is things like meaningless DLC.  Substantive exclusive content at retailers has been tried before. It didn't do anything but royally piss off gamers and generate negative critical reviews.  Most people are not going to go crazy purchasing from Game Stop for exclusive skins.  You should also be reminded of the fact that Gamestop has already used that business model of exclusive content, it hasn't helped them.

>pricing

So GameStop is going to pay a ton of money to Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo for the privilege of selling their games at less than MSRP to be more attractive in their direct competition with Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo?

>There's literally thousands of ways to make a product attractive to a certain subset of customers.

Sure, but the issue isn't making the product attractive to gamers, it's making your product attractive to the developers and console creators.  MS, Sony, and Nintendo can ink distribution deals with Gamestop all they want, that doesn't mean they're going to undermine their direct sales platforms for it.  There is no incentive for them to turn over direct sales to a middle man now any more than there was incentive to do so over the last 20 years.

>all this money I made today is fake, and you are doing the right thing by sitting in your ETF that's turning a cool 9% YoY.

A bunch of people made a ton of money off TLRY about a year ago.  That doesn't mean the company is worth a damn long term. 

The problem with Gamestop is that everything they want to do is done better by some other platform or distributor.  Their retail spaces are nothing but deadweight.  They dont have a diverse enough group of products to attract substantial foot traffic.  If you go to gamestop retail, you have to be going there to buy a video game or game related item.  Juxtaposed to every other major video game distributor - Target, Walmart, Amazon, hell, even places like Best Buy - there are other reasons to draw you into those stores where you can also get the same physical game media.  It's one less trip.  This also doesn't really account for the problem that their physical retail spaces are never going to be efficiently used.  If they set up smaller retail spaces because their physical product doesn't need much space, they limit their ability to get good foot traffic into the store and they limit their ability to diversify their goods for sale.  If they get a larger space, it mostly ends up being empty floor space while all their product is on the wall, and their return of revenue relative to the cost per sqft of space leased/owned is terrible.

Things are even worse for them in the digital world.  There is *zero* incentive for MS, Nintendo, and Sony to give up their direct to consumer sales on their platforms.  That alone is going to inhibit Gamestops potential, because most people are going to go with the most convenient option for purchasing a digital game - pushing a few buttons on their console and moving on.  Not whatever Gamestops process will be, which will undoubtedly just require more steps by virtue of being a third party.  They aren't a game developer.  They don't have an exclusive library that they can leverage to drive people to their digital storefront like EA can with Origin.  Being a general digital distributor means going up against the Juggernaut that is Steam, nevermind the already established minor players like GamerGate.  

I'm sure that they can pivot to new revenue streams, but that's going to come at a cost.  Look at their new deal with MS.  A big drive of that deal for Gamestop is that MS is going to give Gamestop a cut of downstream revenue for devices Gamestop can bring into the Xbox ecosystem.  Gamestop already has a horrendous reputation for upselling people on things - if they don't work this out properly, it's going to continue to deliver a poor customer experience and just make things continually frustrating and undermine the brand.  There is a built in incentive now for Gamestop to harass people to purchase these items because of the extra revenue potential.

If Gamestop really wants to succeed, they should probably focus on being a ""third space"" in a community.  Make it the hang out for people to come and have an experience in, that you also happen to be able to buy games at.  They need to expand their product out to table tops and card games, engage in community events, and generate reasons for people to come into their retail shops.  Their retail space, if properly leveraged like that, can work against other competitors in the distribution space in the same way that WalMart is angling to leverage their retail stores against Amazon.  Once people are in the store, you can then work on building up that digital loyalty.

Frankly, the way they're going, they're probably just going to be a middling distributor at best.  Nothing special.  Their stock isn't going to be worth a whole lot for it.  You talk about a ""well-established company"" with ""generations of customers.""  The established company has a shit reputation and is on the verge of bankruptcy.  You're also talking about a demographic of customers that are notoriously bitchy and hold wild loyalties to specific companies.

Semiconductors,Investing,ivoxva,Story of how I tried to beat the market and failed,g5t2609,"""Due to those losses, I stopped investing for a couple of months exactly when the prices were at minimum of the year.""

I think a broad issue with this sub that I've seen over the years is that people buy when things are good (eventually - this happens after a couple of months of half a dozen ""WHY IS THE MARKET GOING UP?"" threads every day), but when the market has a correction - something that used to be viewed as normal - it's viewed as almost apocalyptic. I saw a post the other day about Amazon being down 10% as a ""massive decline"" - if you cannot tolerate a 10% decline in Amazon don't own it, because there are times where that's the initial reaction to earnings. If a 10% decline throws your view of owning a company into question, then your thesis on why you bought it in the first place probably wasn't that strong. If something goes down 10% and you look at it in your portfolio and if your first instinct is to dump it, then that tells you exactly how strong you really feel about the company.  Growth stock investing is not going to be trees grow to the moon or years like this where Ark funds are up 70% or whatever they were; there's going to be periods that are highly volatile and far more volatile than the last month - look at growth names at the end of 2018.  This year with growth is not normal; it's a situation where things came together that benefited a lot of growth companies tremendously.

1) I think people have to view a March when the VIX is 80 and the CNN Fear and Greed is 2 and yadda yadda as the time to really lean in. That's the time when if you have an even somewhat longer-term view you're getting opportunities. By the time this sub has warmed up to the market is not the time to lean in.

2) People have to have a longer-term view and not this ""one foot out the door"" mentality where every bit of market volatility and events that might cause volatility is something to flee from. There's been way more threads in the last year where people talk about ""selling everything"" - not a decision that should be easy and a decision you should make very, very rarely - if ever. Volatility creates opportunities, you just have to think in months and years with purchases, not ""OMG WHAT IS THE MARKET GONNA DO TOMORROW?""  

"" I want to know how can I feel less sad about this.""

It's a bummer and I'm sorry that you're dismayed at what happened but you're going to miss opportunities. Everyone does. I owned VFF when it was around $1 and sold not long before it went to $6 and then eventually the high teens. There's plenty of other instances over the years. I think what I'm looking for in terms of individual names has become specific enough that there are things that do well where I know I wouldn't have bought it any way, but with that it's not being bummed as much as trying to understand why it did well and any takeaways - could I have looked at it differently? Etc. If I missed something there's always going to be a bit of dismay, but I've gradually tried to be far more automated about it - is there is a lesson/takeaway from this? y/n? then move on.

There is going to be a lot of ""could haves"" throughout your time in investing. The issue I think becomes that was before and today is a new day - literally. Chasing now after what you could have done is not always going to be the best idea - have to look at it with a fresh perspective and consider what is the best long-term strategy to build on right now.

""When I backtested my ETF purchase across my deposit intervals, I found that I could have made 37.9% in returns""

Could have. I wouldn't base decision making on what things have done, the question becomes what is the potential going forward for the next 3-5 years. I look at my portfolio all the time with the thought of - if I was stuck with this portfolio tomorrow and couldn't sell it for 5 years, would I be okay with that? If something is a no, then changes need to be made. Things are bought with the intent of owning long-term and bought with the view of potential over the coming years. I have no idea what the market will do tomorrow or next week.

""When I want to invest smaller amounts of money, I have to rely on fractional shares and my brokerage doesn't provide that, so I have to shift to Robinhood or other trading platform.""

If you want fractional shares, I'd much rather suggest Fidelity than RH. I don't see the appeal of RH at this point.

""AAPL 20%, MSFT 15%, AMZN 15%, ""

So half your portfolio is the household names everyone already knows, likes and probably owns.

This crisis pulled forward a lot of growth in tech, which has been discussed on multiple company conference calls. Much of tech is doing well or even benefiting from what's going on. I don't know that the kind of run that has occurred YTD is sustainable in the short-term, but beyond that I think society has become more reliant upon technology during this and will continue to be after. Meanwhile, impacted sectors have continued to lag and people question whether some % of these businesses is going to be impaired for a long time - will some % of business travel not come back and be replaced by virtual meetings that save on cost?  While this crisis pulled forward some growth themes, it also pulled forward declines (see mismanaged retailers and the number of bankruptcies this year; retail real estate is not in good shape, either) that would have been more gradual over the coming years.

That's a screenshot of American Airlines' balance sheet from their last quarterly report (10-Q). I've circled a few things - cash and cash like assets at the top. That totals $5.6b. Then, their total 'current assets' (which includes the above) - that's $9.5b.

Moving on down, we see they have $19.5b in current (i.e. short term, due soon) liabilities. For every $1 in short term assets they have, they have $2 in short term debt. For every $1 in cash they have they have $3.5 in debt. That's not counting long term debt, when you throw that in you get $1 in assets for every $6.4 in debt.

So let's say the planes all stop flying the day after this report came out. That debt's still there, you don't get out of the leases. They have $5.6b in cash compared to $61b in debt. Not pretty. More to the point, they have $5.6b in cash vs $19.5b in debt that's \*due soon\*. Sure, they have 9.5b in \*total\* current assets, but a lot of that is tied up in accounts receivable (i.e. people who owe them money and might not pay, given dire enough straits) and stuff like fuel and spare parts.

The issue with cyber security companies is they are selling a product that can change instantly. They need to not only hire some really smart folks (pay them top dollar) but also invest continuously in the latest and greatest (hardware and software); making their previous investments stale and worthless. I don't like short term moats; especially when they have to rebuild new ones. 

I would love to hear a convincing argument that makes these stocks a growth case. 

On the other hand you mentioned $MSFT, I would throw $IBM, $AAPL, $AMZN or $GOOG ($NFLX uses amazon's service so don't pick if you have this thesis) or any company that have their data to protect. They would have a better judgement on what tools and folks to hire for their data. Hell they might even have an internal security product that they might sell!

I would stay away from $HACK, as much as I love the promise, they are competing for these data holders to hire them, when these data holders might simply drop them and use another solution.

That is my thoughts on cyber security stocks; looks great on paper but bad in long term vision. And it might sound nice to hold HACK; however over time only a few will make money and you will soon find it holds a lot of failures.

Link:http://www.vox.com/2015/7/11/8933341/china-is-destroying-its-stock-market-in-order-to-save-it

The Government is also convincing the youth to bring in their money to help ""pump"" up prices, additional aid which will cause a rally provided they listen to their communist government.

Bearing in mind all of this manipulation, the fact that in the past the Chinese stock market rose in correlation with borrowed money and 120 billion yuan is being put into the market, I am probably going to try to ride this wave for 2 week-1 month. If you look at this chart on Bloomberg titled ""Humbris humbeld"" It shows the strong correlation with how borrowed money affected the the indexs movement. With an increase of borrowed money of 250 to 350 (100 billion yuan ) the stock market popped up 60%. 4000 to 6000. That rally lasted 2 months.

Semiconductors,ETFs,1ohr85n,"28, First time investor. Thoughts on these funds & allocations inside Roth ?",nlsdqih,"I would increase exposure to international small cap value (AVDV) to around 10%, decrease exposure to the S&P 500 (perhaps 30% VOO + 15% SPMO), increase exposure to emerging markets (AVEM) to around 10%, and increase exposure to international developed markets in SCHF to around 20%. You would then have a portfolio of:

30% VOO  
15% SPMO  
10% AVUV  
10% AVDV  
10% AVEM  
20% SCHF  
5% IBIT

I actually am not a big fan of SPMO despite recent strong returns since a lot of that came from big tech/AI stocks (like Nvidia), SPMO increases concentration risk and is more susceptible in a market drawdown. If you want to concentrate on the momentum factor, XMMO is another ETF (Invesco MidCap Momentum) which would diversify your portfolio and still concentrate on the momentum factor at the same time. You could go 40% VOO and 5% XMMO.

Semiconductors,ETFs,1ofypf5,NVDA to SMH ETF,nllbi4m,"Just a couple of things to note: I personally don't think long term investment horizon is considered 5-10 years in the investing world but maybe i'm not a popular opinion. To me long term is more like 20-30 years. I'm curious to know why you are only investing to a max age of 31 years old?

That aside, I would offer a suggestion for FTEC or VGT in replace of SMH. I think it gives better exposure to the tech sector. Additionally, expect a max drawdown with your current portfolio to be around about 60-80% due to the overexposure to tech with a core holding of QQQ and SMH (25 stocks all in tech). Sure you can get the higher return but conversely can get hit with a higher loss.

With an investment horizon of 5-10 years I can't reasonably expect a recovery from a massive tech fallout. Volatility blows are softened with longer time horizons and diversification and I personally don't think 5-10 years is enough to recover from a volatility blow should fall victim to one. Take a look at how long it took the US Market to recover after the 2002 ""dot com"" market crash followed by the the 2007 financial crisis.

[(US Large Cap Stock Market) versus (Total Global Market))](https://testfol.io/?s=cHy15uzNU8w)

The blue line on the graph is how a portoflio globally diversified is doing from 2000-2025 and the red line is how a portfolio with only the top 500 US Companies is doing from 2000-2025. 

Notice the S&P 500 falling behind the Total Global Market after April 15, 2002 and never recovering to it's lead until around June 26, 2018. Due to the crashes of 2002 and 2007, a portfolio concentrated only on US Large Cap companies was not making as much money as a portfolio that was globally diversified for a total of 16 years.

With this in mind, bear in mind the realistic possibility of your portfolio tanking and not recovering for 15+ years. This is well over your time horizon of 5-10 years. If you are still okay with that volatility I would recommend holding your positions for 20-30 years to ensure a higher likelihood of getting a positive return on your investment and then moving your portfolio value to much more stable positions.",1761535190.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1ofypf5/nvda_to_smh_etf/nllbi4m/

Semiconductors,ETFs,1ofypf5,NVDA to SMH ETF,nldjwht,"I've been thinking a lot about this too because I love NVIDIA too, but my thesis is this (I'd still be happy to discuss it because I'm not so sure):

Nvidia is the leader in AI GPUs and I believe its moat is so large that in 5-10 years it will still be the leader in AI and will continue to grow incredibly.

BUT based on the law of large numbers, even if companies like AMD or Intel fail to even match NVIDIA and NVIDIA continues to be the undisputed leader in the sector, I believe that these companies, just by the fact of being considerably smaller companies, have more potential for growth in the value of their individual shares by a greater percentage than NVIDIA, purely and exclusively because NVIDIA is so big that making a 2x is much more difficult for NVIDIA (even if it remains the undisputed leader) than for AMD (even if AMD never even manages to match NVIDIA).

That is; I'm not diversifying into Broadcom, Intel, AMD, etc. because I think they'll beat NVIDIA in the long term (in fact, I think NVIDIA will be the winner), but because I think the growth potential of these companies in terms of share valuation is greater than NVIDIA's, because NVIDIA is already enormous.

Likewise, what I like about this 70/30 split is that almost 12% of my portfolio would still be exclusively NVIDIA, so I would still be capturing the growth of the winning company either way.

Mathematically, I agree with your thesis. ETFs have the overwhelming advantage, they are flexible and adaptable. They can adapt to changing market conditions. Maybe there is some company that doesn't even exist yet, but SMH can buy that company, 10 years from now in the future. Your numbers check out, and I think your plan has a high chance of success.

Semiconductors,ETFs,1od54u9,Thoughts on SMH?,nksolkq,"SMH is an interesting one. It’s a big attractor due to past performance. High risk, high reward fund. I’m personally a big semi believer for years now and continue to be so. Keep in mind semiconductors are very cyclical so it can have severe ups and downs. Be willing to have a long term hold if you go into it as it is high risk. Currently industry projects large growth through roughly 2030-2035ish, but it can be hard to tell exactly how much of that growth is already baked in and how much companies can continue to surpass those expectations with already sky high expectations. Very long term since tech is the backbone of a lot of society and will continue to innovate it likely will beat the broad market but with lots of big ups and downs so you need quite the stomach. Earlier this year alone it dropped something like 30-40% or so but as you see it’s recovered big time and even made any holders a lot. 

Just keep in mind while it’s more likely semis outperform the broad market long term, there is no guarantee. Innovation will decline over time and returns will decrease as such, margins may compress as the big growth may have already passed or is nearing its peak (even if growth ultimately continues), we are potentially going into an economic downturn soon, and sectors do rotate. Even if you go long there is still a chance other sectors dominate long term and a broad market fund can beat it still. Or other tech like quantum eventually disrupts it as a power source. I would not set it and forget it long term as a core position unless you REALLY have high conviction in it and are willing to take the risk. Max 5-20% and even 20% is high. Long term though it’s very unlikely to be a bad investment, but just don’t go in expecting constant yearly 20%+ forever is all",1761147945.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1od54u9/thoughts_on_smh/nksolkq/

Semiconductors,ETFs,1obojmw,3-ETF Growth Gamble,nkmbkqm,"The 3-fund strategy you mentioned is used by Bogleheads and it doesn’t work that way at all. The 3 funds are supposed to be VTI, VXUS & BND as the philosophy is for total market coverage in all available global markets while not being selective.

The 36% overlap you quoted in FTEC is not even relevant in this case because the whole growth of FTEC is heavily dependent on top 4 holdings which are MAG7 and these exact same holdings are heavily weighted in S&P500 as well. So, if FTEC is performing then it is because of MAG7 holdings which is true for S&P500 and even the US Stock Market as a whole. 

**However, it doesn’t make sense to hold a ETF which is 21% in NVDA, 17.3% in MSFT, 18.7% in AAPL, 7.5% in AVGO and 2.5% in ORCL which brings the weighting to 67%. That is a ridiculously high level of concentration which is not sensible in any capacity in a portfolio unless you are pure play performance chaser. The performance chasing has almost always never resulted into a portfolio growing into multi-millions but rather imploding and crashing big time.**

You calling others not being able to become millionaires because their growth element is not big is like saying that you should ONLY invest in MAG7 as S&P500 is crap. This perspective is basically due to hindsight and confirmation bias of yours towards TECH sector. 

**Sure, the TECH frenzy may continue for longer into future, but when the pullback happens, your portfolio will be atleast in -60% or more drawdown territory simply because of concentration while S&P500 will be in -30% to -40% territory. This will allow S&P500 to recaliberate to other sectors for a better and quicker recovery while your portfolio will be in shambles and may not even recover if TECH sector goes belly up for any reason whatsoever.**",1761062716.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1obojmw/3etf_growth_gamble/nkmbkqm/

I've seen other comments here saying that bitcon will facilitate no/low-fee instantaneous transactions which is also false.  I'm on mobile so I can't provide exact references, but look it up.

Real value from Crypto comes in the form of Stablecoins. Their value is tied to an underlying asset, which makes them a reliable medium of exchange for everyday transactions which ARE instantaneous. 

If you want to invest in bitcoin that's your prerogative and good luck to you! But if you're looking for actual investment into an asset that provides value then look up CRCL. That is most likely the future, not bitcoin, when it comes to the economic system utilization.",1757530340.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1ndh9yo/set_and_forget_24_yr_old/ndhw0aj/

And yet most IPOs still collapse because hype outweighed fundamentals. Bitcoin never needed Wall Street to print value — the market priced it on day one and it’s still here 16 years later.

>...gamblers selling to other gamblers

Funny — people said the same about early internet stocks before those ‘gamblers’ built trillion-dollar industries. Markets decide what lasts, not angry Reddit comments.

>The tech is awful, no one would want to use it

Billions are already moved globally every day on the network. You don’t have to like it, but calling that “awful” just sounds like denial.

>You’ll sell to another gambler

That’s literally how every secondary market works — stocks, real estate, art, even gold. Someone buys because they value it. That’s the whole point of markets.

No — it makes me diversified. You’ve spent umpteen comments spouting ill-informed twaddle ranting about an asset you incorrectly claim is worthless. Tell me, which one of us really looks obsessed?

Bogleheads will set you up with a diversified 3-fund portfolio of US stocks, international stocks, and bonds so that you are ready for whatever uncertainties the future may bring.

Choosing to put most of your money in FXAIX was a good first step. Of the four funds you mention, in my opinion FXAIX is the highest-quality and most age-appropriate. FXAIX is a Fidelity-branded mutual fund version of Vanguard VOO, the #1 most popular ETF in the world. ""VOO and chill"" is pretty common (and solid!) advice here on ETF sub forum, and FXAIX is synonymous with VOO.",1755088568.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1mp2q34/late_starter_4348_panicking_about_financial_future/n8gho9y/

Semiconductors,ETFs,1mk2703,What to add to my holdings?,n7fipun,"You're doing fine. 

You're overlooking the fact that all the ETFs you're listing basically hold the same top 10 stocks. 

You should study what's under the hood. 

Each ETF website has a ""holdings"" or ""composition"" section that shows you the weight of every constituent in that fund that's trying to match an underlying index. 

If you want even more risk, it's not about adding more ETFs to your portfolio that hold the same stocks. It's more about adding leverage. 

Look into how leverage can obliterate your portfolio. It's not for the faint of heart at high levels. 

At 21, the key for you is to invest in yourself to increase your earning potential, increase your current income, and keep auto-investing. 

All these ETFs discussed in this subreddit all basically track the same top 10 stocks since there's never any new, novel discussion about interesting ETFs. And that's completely fine. 

Best advice I ever got was get my $100K-200K in some broad, blended (growth + value) stock index fund (insert any global, S&P 500, total US stock index fund) before trying to tilt away from market cap weight. For example, I invested my first $200K in FXAIX (Fidelity's S&P 500 fund) held in my 401k before doing anything exotic. 

This ensures you're earning average market returns which is a tremendously positive thing because without insider information, average market returns have generated anywhere from 7-10% annualized average returns. 

Use a investment calculator, adding your own monthly contributions and plug in 7%, 8%, 9%, 10% as the returns and you'll be blown away how amazing compounding returns can be over time.

Semiconductors,ETFs,1me60tu,Thoughts on $CIBR & $SMH ?,n66y6mz,"SMH - Semiconductors will likely continue to outperform the general market for the years to come based on current projections of industry growth. Just keep in mind semiconductors are extremely volatile so you have to have high risk tolerance to not panic sell if things go south. Semis during drops even like one just earlier this year can go down violent like 30-60% at some points. But they also tend to go violently upwards too like they have been recently. Most semi funds are up something like 15-25% or so after falling like 30-40% roughly. If you held you won but tons panic sold and lost. Something to also consider is SMH includes both AI/advanced semis + traditional older semi companies and fabs. In recent years and going forward these older fabs and semi companies have been struggling or just performing worse more often, and fabless/AI/advanced companies have been for the most part vastly overperforming due to not needing capex on fabs while benefitting from high profit margins of semis. SMHX is fabless only and worth considering. It has a much higher valuation and narrow portfolio and risk, but higher profit potential. SMH is more encompassing of the overall semi market big boys, has a lower valuation, and less risk, but likely lower profit potential

CIBR: likely a good choice. Expected CAGR in years to come is higher than market average (just keep in mind this doesn’t guarantee return). It’s hard to imagine an ever growing tech world where cybersecurity doesn’t keep expanding and being more and more needed. AI also helping drive better and new ways to create security which may help raise valuations further. Just keep in mind cybersecurity like semis is also more volatile than the typical market and is priced for growth. So if any pullback happens you may see some violent swings but overall trend is expected long term to be above market average so don’t panic sell if it comes",1753980014.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1me60tu/thoughts_on_cibr_smh/n66y6mz/

Semiconductors,ETFs,1m6vuhj,(22y/o) Portfolio Thoughts,n4t4rkk,">Looking to be aggressive with my Roth IRA (I use Fidelity if it makes a difference). I was initially 80% FZROX 20% FZILX but this subreddit has convinced me to take on more risk.

You're making a beginner level mistake of confusing performance chasing (a common behavioral mistake) with good risk. There's nothing about FZILX that is less aggressive than FZROX, in fact I can make at least 2 arguments that FZILX is more aggressive.

>FZROX 50%

The fund is good.

>SPMO 20%

I believe momentum does have some evidence backing it as a factor that should be expected to boost returns, but I believe it wasn't the strongest factor.

>FTEC 20% (or QQQM?)

This to me screams performance chasing/recency bias.

On FTEC: 
An uncompensated risk is one that doesn't bring higher expected long term returns. Uncompensated risk should be avoided whenever possible. Compensated vs uncompensated risk:

* https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/

* https://www.northerntrust.com/middle-east/insights-research/2024/wealth-management/compensated-portfolio-risk

>But not all risks are compensated with an expected return premium.

* https://www.pwlcapital.com/is-investing-risky-yes-and-no/ (Bold mine)

>Uncompensated risk is very different; it is the risk specific to an individual company, **sector,** or country.

On QQQ(M): What makes you think that ""which of the US exchanges a stock trades on"" is a key factor in future performance? Why bet against only the financial sector?

.
>FIVLX 10%

Why so light?

>I understand I have a massive tech tilt.

What makes you think that either: 

* Tech is still under valued compared to the test of the market

Or 

* Tech is the only sector appropriately priced and everything else is valued too high?

>FIVLX seemed much more appealing than FZILX in terms of total returns. 

At least value does have the higher expected returns going forward as well, but odd that you only apply that factor to ex-US, not the US. This gives further weight to my thoughts that you're making your portfolio based on performance chasing.

>Would love to throw SMH ... in there as well.

Know how I called single sector and uncompensated risk above? That applies to subsectors as well.

Markets already expect great things from tech (and semiconductors), which is why it has already been bid up to being comparatively expensive.",1753314428.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1m6vuhj/22yo_portfolio_thoughts/n4t4rkk/

1. Given your time horizon, it is aggressive but if you can afford to keep the money locked up for that long, or even at least 10 years, I don't see any issues. 

2. There's overlap but the overlap by weight is a lot less than you'd expect going by etfrc.com. SPMO is 100% in VOO for obvious reasons but if you're looking for a momentum based tilt that's not necessarily a problem at all. 

3. I'm not sure if this counts as a Boglehead style portfolio in any way besides the number of funds. As to straying away from low cost diversified investing, you've got VOO as your largest holding which makes up for the ERs of the other funds. You might consider swapping it out with VT though to cover *all* of your bases including international while still retaining the aggressive nature of SPMO and SMH though. This would be a good balance in my mind.

4. If you want to focus on semis, SMH or another semiconductor fund is the way to go. As for VXUS, see my thoughts on swapping VOO for VT on that one. 

Regarding VTI/VXUS/BND, personally I'm not a fan of BND. I think as far as bond funds go, it's just not good. If I were to hold fixed income, and I do not currently hold any beyond futures on treasuries, I would go with ANGL.

it's possible dividend-oriented ETFs might have the best performance over the next 30 years. https://www.indexologyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/aristocrats.jpg

we don't know 100% what's going to perform best in the future, so it's best to be pretty well diversified and avoid assuming today's hot investments will continue their heat into the future. there's also no guarantee US stocks will beat international stocks in the future, and no guarantee tech oriented stocks will give the best results going foward. 

look at the past 25 years, and of the top 10 stocks in the Russell 1000 only 2 of them were tech related.

You could hike up your emerging markets holdings (I like IEMG) if you want to make it a little more spicy.

I can tell you, you probably won't so 100% VOO seems like the safest play.

That being said, I found VT to be too boring to commit to for a long term and after backtesting many strategies over a short 10 year span, which i know was tilted to tech, I have gone with 100% SP500 in the 401k, and 33/33/33 SCHD, SCHG, VOO in the Roth, covering value, dividend, growth and the s and p 500 all in one.

Phase 2 ended early due to overwhelming positive results.  Most investors are holding out for a buyout, expecting $20-$40+ per share.  It's currently under $1.

I have personally traded this stock numerous times throughout their clinical trials just buying under $1 & selling over $4-$5.  It's seriously an easy 5x.  

Analyst Targets for $Atos are $4-$7.50  (without a buyout).  Fair valuation for this stock, comparing to Tamoxifen would be over $5 per share.

  
Company has solid financials.  Dr Quay has already brought several other products to market.  They have patents... It's a good play.

This is evidence-based, as all funds are bound to regress to their mean at one point or another. The only criticism is that small cap funds can underperform for long periods of time and there is less evidence for small cap growth as opposed to small cap value, but international exposure is a solid choice, and so is mid cap exposure, so I’m unsure what their rationale is, unless it’s strictly because you’re not just shouting “SCHG, QQQM, and VGT” which seems to be the going trend. I own all three of those, but you have to keep the tech sector risk limited in these valuations. Trends reverse, and US markets do occasionally underperform, and yes, many of these AI companies are incredibly overvalued, despite the incredible use cases it has.

Your time horizon is 30-40 years. Don’t chase performance from the last decade when you’re going to have these investments for 4x that time.

Also, read up on the dotcom bubble. Not not not saying that what’s happening now is a bubble, but there was a time in the past when tech was doing super great and then it came crashing down. And this has not only happened with tech, it can happen to any sector. The popular sector of today may not be so popular at any point within your time horizon. That’s why you want to own the whole haystack - you’ll get all the needles - instead of trusting that all the needles are in a small clump of hay that looks shiny.

I myself do VT instead of VOO - VT is a total world market index, while VOO is the S&P. I own the haystack. On top of VT, I do tilt to Value - I have Small Cap Value US and Int funds and a much smaller portion of a Large Cap Value fund.

Answer: because you recognize VOO is less risky than putting everything into SPMO or SMH, or countless other ETFs with higher potential returns. You go into VOO because of risk tolerance, which comes from diversification, and even VOO is more diversified than SPMO or SMH.

If your plan is to never change anything, then going all-in on VOO is still riskier than just going VTI, because VTI has a piece of every pie to avoid having to change anything.

If you really want to go VOO, then you can do that, but then the smart thing to do is figure out what goes up when VOO stalls or goes down, then hedge your portfolio by having some of that.

Even if all you do is have a slice of DBMF and TLTW, that works fine. Both just move money into your pocket when things go down. Or shave off some VOO for SPYI, same holdings except SPYI will reduce the pain of downturns and market fluctuations.

So, you are tech heavy - as intended!
If you want to keep the heavy growth-tech emphasis, you might add XMMO to mix to catch the next high flyer on its way up, or replace one of the sector - specific funds
If you want to smooth out your returns, then obviously you can add some more value funds, or diversify into international etfs or gold.
I might suggest you get some downside protection without diminishing your SP 500 large cap exposure that you do clearly (and wisely) desire with GDE

Total waste.  You could have deducted that 3k off your other income, or carried it over for future years/use.  That 3k deduction was lost just trading one pile of money for a virtually equal pile of money.  Since it was only $3000 you didn't lose a kidney or anything like that, but what you did was as a pure unforced error.

There is nothing bad about having both SPY and SPLG in one account, but there is a lot wrong in throwing away $450 in taxes to save $2.10 a year in expenses.

Also a not-great concept, since compared to you, what \_I\_ would do involves completely different risk tolerance, age, goals, interests, etc.  However, given your interests above, starting a position with SMH makes sense.  I'd also suggest reconsidering your positions in QQQ/MSFT/AAPL and instead think about a true tech ETF that solidly weights MSFT and AAPL... like XLK or IYW (or several others).",1748463110.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1kxfg2u/reworking_my_portfolio_after_a_few_years_of/muredwd/

I understand your point of uncompensated risk - all my eggs are in the US, large cap stocks mostly in tech. However I’m just worried about picking anything else because they feel like more of a gamble. Also other markets other than the US haven’t had as high returns from what I can tell. So my first question is why not BRK-B? It just seems like a safer actively managed stock that gets good growth? Its large market cap doesn’t mean much to me as it is a well principled company.

My second question comes at your next point, if not the US market, where else, I’m in search of good growth and not dividends and no other markets I have looked at offer that growth similar to US. I don’t plan to go find the next apple and I want assured growth/profitability and reliability that will enable long term growth.

I think the time to invest in growth was 10 years ago. I’m not in favor of timing the market, but I am in favor of buying assets when they’re fairly valued, and a lot of growth isn’t in my humble opinion.

I’m generally in favor of a diversified portfolio if it’s for retirement. If growth performs poorly you’re gonna get left behind. I think the most important part of “catching up” is personal finance and saving, not trying to optimize a portfolio.

But by all means, if you think you know something the market doesn’t and wanna go all in on growth, feel free to roll the dice.

Edit: And remember, “growth” doesn’t mean your portfolio will “grow” more but with greater volitility (even though that’s what has happened recently). It’s simply the category of companies that have to “grow” into their current valuations. If I were gonna try to beat the market in my retirement fund I would be betting on value now, not growth.

Semiconductors,ETFs,1j0sw6d,First time getting into stocks,mfecccp,"Here's some ways to help narrow down your choices and understand them more:

VOO, VOOG, VOOV - The G and V funds split VOO into growth and value. There's no need to have all 3 because VOO has the same as G+V combined. The only reason to buy G or V would be if you want to tilt towards growth or value, but if you want a blend of both then just buy VOO.

VTI - This is the total US market and 87% of it is taken up by the same holdings as VOO. It just adds smaller stocks not in the S&P 500. It's kind of redundant to have both VTI and VOO since there's so much overlap. Just pick one, or you can buy VXF, which is all the stocks that VTI has that VOO doesn't. So VOO+VXF=VTI

VXUS - Total international market excluding the US. No overlap with the rest of these since they're all US funds.

VUG - Similar to VOOG, focused on growth stocks. They have somewhat different holdings, but are still going to be very similar. If you want to lean towards growth, just pick one or the other.

QQQ, QQQM - These are basically the same thing, they're both the Nasdaq 100 index. It has a lot of tech and growth stocks, but it's not specifically targeting them. VOO and VTI will have all the same stuff, but this is more volatile because it's more concentrated. QQQ is better for daytrading and QQQM is better long term. I would just go for QQQM if you want it. But if you want to specifically target growth or tech then VUG or VGT might be better.

VGT - Tech stocks, many of these are in the growth funds, VOO, and QQQ, but this is more targeted.

SMH - Semiconductor tech stocks only. Very volatile and kind of a risky bet as it's really concentrated in a few companies. VGT is also risky but more spread out over many companies.

SCHD - Stocks with high dividends, generally more stability and value focused as well.

I think VOO is a good choice for the US market, but know you will be missing out on international markets and it's possible they will outperform the US in the future. If you just want to keep it simple and don't want any extra risk then I would probably avoid all the growth and tech funds for now. My recommendation is just pick VOO or VTI for most of your portfolio, doesn't matter too much which one. And I would recommend at least some amount of VXUS so you're not only invested in one country. If you want to match the market it would be 35% VXUS. If you want the ultimate simplicity of just 1 fund, I would recommend VT, which is the same as 65% VTI + 35% VXUS, just tracking the total world index like the other commenter posted. That's about as neutral as you can get with stocks and is (in theory) the most reliable option long term.",1740814242.0,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1j0sw6d/first_time_getting_into_stocks/mfecccp/
Semiconductors,ETFs,1j0sw6d,First time getting into stocks,mff33z6,"I think it’s totally fine to buy a gold etf, it’s way easier to buy and sell it. I buy Actual gold for a few reasons; no expense ratio (GLD has 0.4% which eats in your gains), you see the actual product you’re buying not just another number on your screen, it’s less liquid (I can’t tell you how many times I tend to monkey around with my stocks because it’s so easy to sell them and buy them, but with physical gold it’s kind of a pain in the ass to sell, and by the time I get a quote thinking I’m gonna cash out, a couple days have already transpired and I decide to just keep it)… It makes it easier on the upside and the downside when the price moves around and with physical goods, you view times when the price goes down as a good thing because you can get more of the product for cheaper, (which is the same for stocks, but all you see are numbers on the screen and emotional cues like red or green or various colors to get you excited and make impulsive decisions). Real investing is a slow boring accumulation process. If you try to rush it by market timing, you’ll find out that you under perform most of the time. I would have a lot more money if all I did was buy VOO and do nothing else, buty my head in the sand and focus on my job/skills. But you’ll notice that after several months have gone by, You’ll tend to look at the price more and you’ll start thinking that you’re some kind of wizard and can predict the future because you saw some bullshit on the news because you read some thing about the yield curve, or the market is making a double top or a head and shoulders or another Random pattern that has no correlation with reality.

Final note, investing is half a psychological battle, even if you buy something that is statistically proven to outperform over the long-term like the S&P 500, It’s also the case that most investors tend to underperform the index that they buy because they impulsively buy and sell and fuck up their gains in the process. You could buy something with a lower return, but due to investor psychology, you end up out-performing an asset that has proven to be more fruitful simply because you diamond hand it the entire time. If I look at my taxable account where I try to get an edge try to market time, try in vain to pick a couple good stocks, It has underperformed both my retirement account, which I just throw into VOO at the start of the year and don’t give it a second thought. It has also underperformed my investment into gold for the same reason. You’ll have more success on paper and in theory by purchasing time proven ETFS, but you will fair far worse if you keep moving strategies buy and sell etc. the more you tinker the less you make. It’s funny how it works. they say that statistically the best investors are those that forget their account password or die. I compare my hard work in my taxable with my retirement accounts, and I am slowly realizing that I’m not smart enough to out perform the algorithms and the people that get paid to actually find stock values, but if I simply buy and hold quality, ETFs, I can actually outperform the top people for probably the same reason… If you are investing correctly, it actually kind of sucks in a psychological sense.

Semiconductors,ETFs,1izo81h,ETF allocation for a 16 year old,mf4i1xj,"**You have alot of reading and learning to do but its great that you’re starting at such a young age.**

Being agreessive and investing into highly risky investments with no compensated risk is an easy way of losing your hard earned money. Also, going high risk **DOESN’T GUARANTEE** that you will accrue massive capital gains and become a millionaire over night or in a few years. **The key is being consistent with your investing strategy and finding the ETFs that provide you best risk-adjusted returns.**

All of your picks except VT & AVUV are performance chasing MAG7 stocks and have massive overlap thereby concentrating a large majority of your portfolio into a handful of stocks, all based in US.

Additionally, you seem to not like the idea of International Diversification like all the new investors which has actually been proven to improve the risk-adjusted returns of a 100% equities portfolio. Your choice, I guess.

From my perspective, a better suggested allocation for you, if you want a 100% equities portfolio that is globally-diversified and has best risk-adjusted returns would be as per below:

**US: VOO or VTI @ 50%**

**US Small Cap Value: AVUV @ 20%**

**Ex-US: VXUS @ 30%**

As far as strategy, the Faber Study may interest you...

The Faber Study provided valuable insights by analyzing the 10-month moving average rule dating back to the 1900s. A $100 investment in the Buy and Hold approach would have compounded to a return of over 2 million, whereas the 10-month timing approach would have yielded just over 5 million.

Understanding the 10-Month Moving Average Strategy

The 10-month moving average strategy is a type of market timing strategy that helps investors make informed decisions about when to enter or exit the stock market. This strategy relies on calculating the average stock price over a 10-month period and using this figure as a benchmark.

Here’s how the 10-month moving average strategy works in simple terms:

Calculate the average closing price of a particular stock or index (such as the S&P 500) over the past 10 months.

If the current stock price is above the 10-month moving average, it signals a potential buying opportunity. This indicates that the stock or index is in an uptrend, and it’s a good time to invest.

Conversely, if the current stock price is below the 10-month moving average, it may be time to sell or avoid buying the stock. This suggests that the stock or index is in a downtrend, and it’s better to wait for a more favorable buying opportunity.

Someone who is 100% VOO will easily beat you in the long term or by the average retirement age. Better more, someone who invest into VTI + VXUS + BND will also highly likely beat your portfolio returns in the long term.

The backtests you have performed are mainly affected by the recency bias and nothing more. There is a reason why Total Market Index Funds beat mostly all the actively managed funds and newbie investors who think they’re geniuses especially when the current Bull Run is the longest and most exceptional case of performance demonstrated by US Market.

On top of that, you have utterly disregarded all the unnecessarily high MERs that come with those specific sector and performance chasing ETFs.

And lastly, you’re forgetting that you need to balance the portfolio to set allocations atleast once annually. NOT at all worth the time and effort given that you need to do this for decades before you can actually retire.

A better suggested allocation for you, if you want a 100% equities portfolio that is globally-diversified and has better risk-adjusted returns would be as per below:

US: VOO or VTI @ 55%

US Small Cap Value: AVUV @ 15%

Ex-US: VXUS @ 30%

This is the simplest Set it & Forget it portfolio that has you covered in all directions. All you need to do is DCA or Lump Sum invest whenever you have extra cash available.",1740113692.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1iugslt/tell_me_why_my_overcomplicated_portfolio_sucks_or/mdxrh54/

Sure they are more stable historically and they will help stabilize your portfolio, but that only matters in a bear market which is about 20% of the time. I'd also go light on the non-US stocks which underperform US in EVERY yr+ time frame you choose (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 10, 20 year). What I would do is pick a low cost ETF like SCHG (I compared everything, just like you did and this wins every match-up in NEARLY every time comparison) and has an expense ration of only .04%, then add ETFs for the portion of the S&P that’s underweighted in SCHG. I chose SPYV and SCHD. SCHD is also a stabilizer and has lower performance historically compared to SCHG, but it is supposed to and it has a decent and growing dividend. Personally, I also added some extra tech that is not covered well by the SCHG via SMH (16% overlap mostly because it is heavy on NVDA at 19%).

Semiconductors,ETFs,1iugslt,Tell Me Why My Overcomplicated Portfolio Sucks Or Doesn’t,mdz6d6o,"Small Cap Value tilt has been confirmed to outperform Large Caps in a diverse range of conditions. This was factually proven through emperical data and the analysts who proved it also won Nobel Prize for it, they are Eugene Fama & Kenneth French.

Yes, SCV is in VTI but its barely 2-3% of it because VTI is Market Cap weighted and Small Cap Value is hence quite a small fragment of it. You have to increase your exposure by tilting into SCV stocks through AVUV or DFSV to improve your risk-adjusted returns.

The 3 ETFs I suggested has coverage on literally everything that comes to mind from a global stock market perspective and helps you keep sanity while having a simplified investing strategy.

What you’re rather doing is performance chasing by tilting into TECH heavily using SCHG & other ETFs and de-diversifying your portfolio by concentrating it into MAG7 stocks.

All TECH & Growth Stocks are investing into same MAG7 stocks but at ridiculously high allocations wherein these stocks are 50-60% of the ETFs total allocation while all other stocks are laggards.

Semiconductors,ETFs,1ilek1f,Portfolio Build - Help Please,mc19jli,"AVUS is not bad but has a 0.15 expense ratio.  Avantis and Dimensional (Avantis folks broke off from Dimensional and use very similar lightly-managed approaches to their funds) do some light screening for fundamentals (profitability, debt, etc) and then try to use traders to help them eek out some inter-day deals for buy/sell.  I honestly like Avantis and Dimensional for international, but would not personally use them for domestic, at least in their big ""core"" funds.  My rationale is that the US market is so highly information rich that I am skeptical their process can deliver sufficient value for US.

You can compare here: [https://totalrealreturns.com/s/AVUS,VTI,VOO](https://totalrealreturns.com/s/AVUS,VTI,VOO)

I see you have talked yourself into a higher bond position.  Asset allocation is a very personal decision and can and likely will change as folks get closer to retirement.  If I had a substantial real estate investment, I would likely consider that as a significantly diversified asset and would probably not hold many bonds.

You may want to look into some Bogleheads information, its a good crash course in a lot of investing information even if you do not end up agreeing with all of their takes.  It will help you think through some of the considerations you have now.  https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Main\_Page'

Edit: I think you may have meant AVUV in your question.  That is US Small Cap Value (SCV), which is, potentially, a very good idea.  There is some research (Fama and French) that indicates certain ""factor"" premiums that are compensated risks.  The sweet spot from their research was small cap value which have, historically, delivered higher than market (here meaning total US cap weighted index - which is what VTI is and VOO approximates).  However, these small cap premiums exist over very long time periods (certainly not a decade, possibly not even two).  Their are compelling arguments currently for many factor premiums being already ""priced-in"" to equities, so there is no free lunch left.  Other folks say this isn't true.  The folks who buy SCV recommend committing to it as a nearly permanent holding.  It also is not so highly correlated to the total market, so even if it doesn't overperform, it could at least provide diversification.  VOO has no small cap and VTI has very little since its cap-weighted.  If you do believe in SCV premium, I would personally use VOO paired with AVUV.  If you do not, VTI may be a better broad diversification bet.",1739204127.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1ilek1f/portfolio_build_help_please/mc19jli/

Semiconductors,ETFs,1ifpsww,US portfolio for newbies_20years,mai9do0,"sooooo you want to be 95% invested in technology only, got it. 

well, i cannot say this is a well rounded profile since every etf you want is either a tech etf or is mainly comprised of tech. 

you should really learn about etf overlap. you want your etfs to fit like puzzle pieces across the market, not entirely overlap each other to the point of eclipsing them. 85% of qqqm is in voo, so you are just buying the same stocks in another etf. you aren’t benefiting yourself here, just complicating your portfolio to feel “diversified” without understanding that they contain the same stocks. 

use this website to help visualize your etf overlap: https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php

your whole portfolio should be 2-5 etfs MAX. your portfolio should be aggressive, yet diversified. 

you should also educate yourself more on etf terminology. you should know what growth or value etfs, market caps, sectors, and expense ratios are. aiq has a 0.68% expense ratio, which is stupidly high. smh has a 0.35%, which is still very high. honestly, you should really never invest in any etf with more than a 0.15% expense ratio. if you want to invest in certain sectors, find etfs with low expense ratios or invest directly in the stocks that make up those etfs so you don’t get robbed from those fees.

there is nothing wrong with investing in sector etfs, but they should not make up a considerable amount of your portfolio. the vast majority of sector etfs will never outperform VOO over the long term, so unless you believe the sector will continue to perform well in 30 years, just stick to the broad etfs or invest in a few individual stocks instead. 

you are young, so you want an aggressive position. VOO is already aggressive and tech heavy thanks to the major growth of tech companies this past decade. 

your portfolio 
 1. should have a main driver etf that will take up the largest percentage of your portfolio. i recommend either, VOO, SCHG, VTI, or VT. VTI and VT are the US and world markets respectively, so if you choose them, you only need 1 other etf because they are already so diversified. 
2. should have a diversifier etf. if you don’t choose VTI or VT, then you need an etf to be your diversifier. lots of people choose momentum etfs because they cover lots of sectors and cover lots of market caps at once. i recommend VFMO or SPMO. VFMO grows a little slower, but is more diversified and secure since it has 600 stocks vs SMPO’s 96. 
3. can have a small cap etf. since VOO and VFMO/SPMO cover the large/mid growth and value stocks, you are left with small cap stocks. you can get AVUV, which is a small cap value etf, if you want. it’s not necessary, but it does diversify you further. 
4. should have an international etf like VXUS. it is recommended that you are exposed to the international markets in case the US market doesn’t do well.

OVERALL, you do what you want. but, if you want to have a balanced etf that you can manage easily, it should be 2-5 etfs, depending if you choose VTI/VT or not. you can also have 0-30% of your total portfolio be dedicated to stocks if you want to get more aggressive or have that replace your sector etfs. without being diversified, you are taking on lots of risk. 

two basic portfolios that is well rounded yet aggressive is 40%VOO, 20%VFMO, 15%AVUV, 15%VXUS, and 10% stocks. am even simpler one is 20%VOO/sector etfs, 50%VTI, 10% bonds, 20% stocks. if you want to lean into tech, get VOO and VTI. but know that the top 10 holdings of VTI are basically the same as VOO. go onto their webpages and look for yourself. 

feel free to move the percentages around. the point is to have growth stocks in your etf that are aggressive while having other etfs to diversify yourself in case of poor days.",1738473669.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1ifpsww/us_portfolio_for_newbies_20years/mai9do0/

Semiconductors,ETFs,1hu419g,Advice on first investment pie,m5it49u,"You have found very lucrative ETFs, some of the most lucrative in recent history. I just recently looked at all of these myself and had to make a decision.

You have a lot of overlap. QDVE is just a subset of the S&P500. And the semiconductor ETF is even more sector specialized. If you're looking for security of investment and are risk-averse, you might want to invest a certain percentage in the broader market (like world etfs). But that's up to you. You will probably miss out on gains that way though.

Your portfolio is very tech heavy and US heavy. Now I believe there's still lots of room for growth as the sector includes AI and quantum. But it might also be a bubble waiting to burst. You'll also be more susceptible to temporary losses (2022-2023 drop was heavier here than just S&P 500, and even more so than in world). I assume you being young your plan is investment for decades, so you're likely going to be fine as markets recover over time. Just don't panic sell.

Tax wise I'm German, I don't know how it is in the Netherlands. However we always pay tax on dividends, so you should double-check how reasonable the Equity ETF is in your case or whether it would make more sense to have an accumulative ETF instead. We have a tax free amount of 2000 Euro per year but with an equity ETF you have less control over how much you get out.

Another thing in Germany is that we pay a certain annual amount per ETF. So at least for us it makes sense to have fewer ETFs.

So double-check the feasibility tax wise of the equity ETF for you. Consider adding a world ETF for added security. Choose either one of the Information Technology and Semiconductor, it makes little sense to have both as they're very similar. Or just go with the S&P500. Or drop the S&P500 and just put more into QDVE or SMH instead if you don't mind high risk (potential) high gains.",1736085935.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1hu419g/advice_on_first_investment_pie/m5it49u/

2.  Cryptocurrency is not an investment.  Cryptocurrency doesn't produce anything or improve in any way.

Stocks, for example, represent companies that produce goods & profits to earn profits.  If you buy stock, you get a portion of a company.  Eventually, you expect to have that portion of the company plus a portion of  whatever profits the company produces.  That's an investment.

If you buy a Bitcoin, you get a Bitcoin.  You won't eventually have the Bitcoin plus anything else.  The Bitcoin might be worth more (or less) than when you bought it, but it won't have changed or produced anything.

When you buy cryptocurrency, someone else is selling it to you.  The seller probably thinks that the crypto is overvalued.  You think it's undervalued.  If you're right, you'll probably make a profit.  If the seller is right, you probably won't.  That's speculation.

I'll stick with my portfolio of investments in total-market index-based low-cost stock and bond funds.  I'm not interested in speculating that I know more than others about the future value of crypto

3.  ""Everyone has a plan 'til they get punched in the mouth."". Mike Tyson
For many investors, their first long bear market is the punch in the mouth that wrecks their plan.

I'm glad I've always had some bonds in my portfolio.  At least 30%, I think.  They've helped me hang onto my stocks through some long bear markets and retire at 57.  

Bonds usually don't reduce the returns of a portfolio by nearly as much as lots of people seem to think.  They reduce volatility a lot more.

I'm a mathematician, but I know that psychology is also important to investing.  Higher long-term returns don't matter if an investor sells in a panic, especially if they swear off buying stocks ever again.

I'd rather see a new investor err on the side of being a bit too conservative.  If they get through their first long bear market okay & realize that they have a higher risk tolerance, they can become more aggressive",1735748519.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1hquvfq/what_do_you_think_of_adding_a_sector_etf_to_my/m4v5ax5/

If Trump (don't kick me - this is relevant) tariffs come in hot and heavy, and a bunch of undocumented immigrants start self deporting, those are both inflationary.

And then there are the wild cards of the Department of Government Efficiency...

I like CLOZ, but JBBB or JAAA are good places to earn some cash while you wait. 9% guaranteed is a pretty good deal when you are watching the market whipsaw from euphoria to despair three times a week. I can sit on cash for a long time if I am making money while I wait. I might not make as much if the market soars, but I also am not risking anything if it crashes. 

SVOL is another good alternative, but you can't treat it like cash. When it drops, you have to wait for the recovery.

If you are near retirement, then you may want to start selling it and shift it toward dividend ETFs like SCHD as Nvidia is the dominant factor in SMH, which makes it volatile.

I just started investing at the end of last year and kept SMH around 10% in my investment profolio since then, which is around the same for AVUV and VXUS.

SMH is a ""sector fund"" which means it is not diversified, and is instead focused on one particular industry: tech. SMH actually goes a step farther than another tech fund like VGT, because SMH is even narrower in its focus: semiconductors. *SMH holds 26 stocks*, 3 of which comprise 42% of the fund's value. 

Contrast that with a broad market index fund like VTI, which is well diversified and holds 3600 stocks.

Obviously SMH has had very good performance of late. I'm not even necessarily suggesting you sell. Just make sure you appreciate that you are not diversified and if the industry sours for any reason, the fund will come crashing back down to earth.

Semiconductors,ETFs,1hn1lyf,Opinions on SMH?,m3yp6xa,"No.  Buying individual stocks or sector funds creates unnecessary & uncompensated risk; I avoid doing so. Index funds are boring, but better for making money. If I wanted to talk about my interesting investments at parties or wanted a new hobby, I might invest 5-10% of my portfolio in individual stocks. As it is, I own pretty much every publicly-traded company in the world; that's interesting enough for me.

All of the individual stocks & sector funds are being followed by thousands or millions of other investors. Current prices reflect their collective knowledge of future expectations for each one. I'm a member of the Triple Nine Society, but I'm not smarter than all of them. If I found a stock or sector that looked like a bargain, the most likely explanation would be that the others know something I don't.

I retired at 57 years old. Investing doesn't have to be complicated or costly to be successful; simple & inexpensive is most effective.

I invest 100% in total-market, index-based, low-cost mutual funds. Specifically, I use mostly Vanguard's 
Total Stock Market, 
Total Bond Market, 
Total International Stock Market, & 
Total International Bond Market funds. 
I've been investing this way for 35+ years. It's effective, simple, & inexpensive.

My asset allocation (ratios of the funds mentioned) is based on my need, ability, & willingness to take risks. Market conditions are not a factor. Vanguard's investor questionnaire (personal.vanguard.com/us/FundsInvQuestionnaire) helps me determine my asset allocation.

www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started has some great free resources to learn about investing. After a few hours reading the articles, and, especially, watching the Bogleheads Philosophy videos, most beginners can learn how to get better results than most professionals.

I prefer mutual funds, but ETFs could also work well. The differences are usually trivial for a long-term investor, especially if they're the Vanguard funds I mentioned above. Actually, the Vanguard funds I mentioned above have both traditional mutual fund shares & ETF shares; they both represent a piece of the same fund.

The funds I use comprise Vanguards target date funds and LifeStrategy funds; these are excellent choices for many investors. Using the component funds allows some flexibility that can have tax benefits, but also creates the need for me to rebalance them periodically. Expense ratios are slightly higher than for the components but are well worth it for many investors.

Other companies have funds similar to the ones I own that would work well. I prefer Vanguard because they've been the leader in this type of investing for decades & because Vanguard's customers are also Vanguard's owners.

Semiconductors,ETFs,1hn0ias,Please evaluate my portfolio,m3y4jqv,"Just a suggestion. You have alot of overlap. 

Basically, VOO = SPY = IVV. So just consolidate all of those allocation into VOO since that’s the biggest holding of your portfolio tracking S&P 500 index.

AIQ, PPA & SMH are thematic ETFs and not that great as a choice if you have a long term investment horizon of 20+ years. They may give you great returns in short term but who knows how it will go after 20+ years. Also, all of them have very high MER compared to VOO which will eat into your capital gains.

If you want to take a compensated risk, then investing 10-15% into AVUV for Small Cap Value will be a wise decision. This essentially would make your portfolio look like below:

VOO: 75%

AVUV: 15%

FBTC: 10% (Rounding-off for ease)

But your statement of ""the last 5 years"" misrepresents or just ignores the actual history of the ETF.

SMH has a long history and we can compare it to something like SPY by looking at which performed better each year.

Since 2000 (when SMH launched), SPY has performed better in 8 years while SMH has performed better in 15 years.

Semiconductors,ETFs,1hk07dd,Worst ETF recommendations of 2024?,m3hsk0m,"Unfortunately only about 30% of the population knows about these contracts although Fidelity and Vanguard use them when their 401k owners are nearing retirement because they allow you to turn your account into income for life at much much higher income rate than mutual funds or ETFs or stocks can.  

You have to sell an ETF, stock, or mutual fund to get income and eventually you run out of money.

These are contracts that are bought to pay you for life and some even increase in payment after taking income but never go down in payment amount.

Similar to how Vanguard is an owner based mutual fund company there are a few owner based Equity Indexed Annuity Contracts that you can buy for retirement and they tend to outperform the rest of the industry.

They are specifically designed to pay retirement income for life and have a lot of guarantees.  

It’s almost like designing an income or pension plan… and is the perfect complement to a stock based portfolio…

If your ETFs goes down in value but your EIA jumps up to $10,000 month you’re ok letting the market recover, 
but …
If your $1 Million ETF goes down to $500,000 close to retirement, statistically, you will move it , and miss the recovery…

Especially if you realize that in order to last for a lifetime your $500,000 account will only generate about $1250/month at a safe 3% withdrawal rate for you…

It’s a really smart move to add EIAs to any stock based portfolio…",1734987598.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1hk07dd/worst_etf_recommendations_of_2024/m3hsk0m/

Semiconductors,ETFs,1hk07dd,Worst ETF recommendations of 2024?,m3cigmg,"I wish I had a crystal ball. S&P 500 low cost index is always the safe bet over the really long term.  Invest & Forget for as long as you can with recurring paycheck deductions.

But here’s what I’m doing right now.

FBTC - about 5%. Hold on for dear life and don’t touch for at least 10 years.

VOO / VOOG: large caps standard brokerage 
FNILX: large caps retirement accounts 

VB: most my small cap
IJR: a bit more selective small cap

Why?

Bitcoin will give you heart burn like you wouldn’t believe, but over a long horizon it has made a lot of really happy people. I have straight BTC through Coinbase, but I also like FBTC as a way to put BTC into my Roth / 401k.

Many people think VOO and VOOG are on a cliff because the S&P500 is over heated.  Those people will be right one of these days/years. But any drop will be temporary over the long term.  

Funstradt thinks they hit 7000 sometime in 2025, but then said they’ll fall off in the second half finishing at 6,600.

I actually have all of my Roth & 401k S&P in FNILX because it is zero fee and I have no intention of touching it for a long time. I don’t need the ability to trade it like an ETF. So, I like saving on management fees.

Fundstradt has been thinking small caps are due for a rotation of investing from large to small.  They’ve been wrong about this for almost a year which has cost me money that I wish I’d left in Large cap.  But it is worth noting that other investment banks are getting more bullish on small caps this year. So, I have been rotating new contributions to VB / IJR. Also, with falling high yield savings, I’m taking some cash off the sidelines and putting more of it in small caps.  Hope the bet pays off.

The earnings per share is much more attractive in small caps.  Also, the lowering of rates helps them more.  However, the threat of tariffs puts inflation at high risk, affecting their bottom line and risking the Fed changing direction.  

From a small cap perspective, IWM is the most frequently mentioned and has high liquidity.  I like VB better because it is a bit more selective while having a better expense ratio.  After that, I’ve been putting some in IJR.  I also was doing XSMO which was killing it until the large couple of dips since November.  Even so, it has outperformed AVUV, which I stupidly invested a bit in after all the reditter’s were loving on it all year.

I’m considering putting in a trailing stop order of 5% on some of my S&P500 index funds to protect against major drops. However, whenever I’ve sold in the past, I never knew when to get back in and lost out on some big gains.

All of which is to say, I wish I had a crystal ball.",1734905074.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1hk07dd/worst_etf_recommendations_of_2024/m3cigmg/

Semiconductors,ETFs,1hjibyc,Which are good ETF's for investment and strategy for investment.,m37y5ql,"Buying individual stocks or sector funds (like SMH) creates unnecessary & uncompensated risk; I avoid doing so. Index funds are boring, but better for making money. If I wanted to talk about my interesting investments at parties or wanted a new hobby, I might invest 5-10% of my portfolio in individual stocks. As it is, I own pretty much every publicly-traded company in the world; that's interesting enough for me.

All of the individual stocks & sector funds are being followed by thousands or millions of other investors. Current prices reflect their collective knowledge of future expectations for each one. I'm a member of the Triple Nine Society, but I'm not smarter than all of them. If I found a stock or sector that looked like a bargain, the most likely explanation would be that the others know something I don't.

QQQ is a great marketing gimmick for NASDAQ & uncompensated risk for investors.  No thanks! Picking stocks based on which exchange they're traded on reduces diversification but doesn't increase expected returns.  PepsiCo & Coca-Cola - one is in QQQ & 1 is not, because 1 trades on NASDAQ & the other doesn't.  (BTW, QQQ & QQQM are almost  identical except for the expense ratios.)

www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started has some great free resources to learn about investing. After a few hours reading the articles, and, especially, watching the Bogleheads Philosophy videos, most beginners can learn how to get better results than most professionals. Bogleheads is named after John Bogle, founder of Vanguard.

I retired at 57 years old. Investing doesn't have to be complicated or costly to be successful; simple & inexpensive is most effective.

I invest 100% in total-market, index-based, low-cost mutual funds. Specifically, I use mostly Vanguard's 
Total Stock Market, 
Total Bond Market, 
Total International Stock Market, & 
Total International Bond Market funds. 
I've been investing this way for 35+ years. It's effective, simple, & inexpensive.

My asset allocation (ratios of the funds mentioned) is based on my need, ability, & willingness to take risks. Market conditions are not a factor. Vanguard's investor questionnaire (personal.vanguard.com/us/FundsInvQuestionnaire) helps me determine my asset allocation.

I prefer mutual funds, but ETFs could also work well. The differences are usually trivial for a long-term investor, especially if they're the Vanguard funds I mentioned above. Actually, the Vanguard funds I mentioned above have both traditional mutual fund shares & ETF shares; they both represent a piece of the same fund.

The funds I use comprise Vanguards target date funds and LifeStrategy funds; these are excellent choices for many investors. Using the component funds allows some flexibility that can have tax benefits, but also creates the need for me to rebalance them periodically. Expense ratios are slightly higher than for the components but are well worth it for many investors.

Other companies have funds similar to the ones I own that would work well. I prefer Vanguard because they've been the leader in this type of investing for decades & because Vanguard's customers are also Vanguard's owners.

I hope that helps! I'd be happy to help w/ further questions. Best wishes!",1734829926.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1hjibyc/which_are_good_etfs_for_investment_and_strategy/m37y5ql/

Otherwise, you can buy just straight VOO or VTI which will lessen the amount of tech coverage you have.

Semiconductors,Bogleheads,1oit3kb,Under 30: is it really worth it to max out both Roth IRA and 401K,nlzhhao,"1.  With Roth IRA and 401(k) you need to speak of compounded RETURNS, not interest.  The optimal investment with these accounts are low fee index funds, which invest in the global market of stocks.  We generally are not speaking of bonds w/r/t young aggressive investors.

2. You are unlikely to beat the market by taking more risk.  Index funds are the sweet spot of maximizing units of return relative to units of risk with little personal effort (See point 4 for discussion of investments that take effort).  

3. Bogleheads are often older, because they only become Bogleheads after a decade or so of trying what you propose unsuccessfully (or, it takes so much effort that they decide the extra half percent in returns wasn’t worth the effort.)

Semiconductors,Bogleheads,1oit3kb,Under 30: is it really worth it to max out both Roth IRA and 401K,nlzo0f9,"If your marginal tax rate is 25%, just as an example, then the tax advantage of a 401(k) is an instantaneous 33% return, just by avoiding income taxes on that contribution (contributing $100 to your 401(k) instead of $75 to your taxable). If your employer does a 50% match on that $100, then you’re contributing $150 to your 401(k) instead of $75 to your brokerage, for an instantaneous 100% return

The tax advantage is actually the same for a Roth, just that the tax exemption comes at withdrawal time. Mathematically, they’re the same as long as the tax rate is the same (search this sub if you want an in depth explanation why)

It takes *a lot* of difference in investment returns to make up for the advantages of a tax-exempt retirement account, even before thinking about any employer match. Does your 401k have a total world market fund? Or a total US and a total ex-US? Even an S&P 500 + a small cap fund would be jusssssst fine (in all these cases, you want your split between these investments to match market weight e.g. 60% US, 40% ex-US)

For starters: Retirement accounts are vehicles for investment that are tax advantaged. You can invest in ETFs and individual stocks in your retirement accounts but it’s not recommended because you’re not a fortune teller and you’d be gambling your future away.

Semiconductors,Bogleheads,1oit3kb,Under 30: is it really worth it to max out both Roth IRA and 401K,nm02nk0,"You're conflating two things that are really separate issues: saving/investing, and tax management.  You're doing the right thing by prioritizing savings, and allocating as much as you prudently can towards your future.  Keep doing this, making sure that you have adequate cushions in cash equivalents for rainy days.  Buy and hold diversified investments.

But tax management is a different thing.  Your tax management strategy -- which is a highly individual thing, very situation dependent -- will dictate the best place(s) to hold your savings.  If you are paying super high taxes now and expect to have a much lower tax rate when you retire, the traditional IRA / 401(k) looks pretty good.  If your current tax burden is low, Roth is great.  If you have investable money left over after maxing out the tax-advantaged accounts, stuff it in a taxable brokerage account.

Just remember that when you are looking at your traditional IRA / 401(k), ALL THAT MONEY IS NOT YOURS.  A significant portion of that money belongs to the tax man, often a third or more.  I know it is very hard at your age to think forward to when you are in your 70s, but when RMDs kick in you will be very happy you didn't put everything into a traditional IRA / 401(k).",1761743171.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1oit3kb/under_30_is_it_really_worth_it_to_max_out_both/nm02nk0/

Semiconductors,Bogleheads,1mvoq8k,Investment advice for 64 yr old who has retired,n9tknyj,"You are retired and your proposed asset allocation is 70% equities 30% cash and *zero* bonds.

Are you relying on withdrawals from this portfolio to fund your living expenses during retirement? Or do you have other income streams (e.g. Social Security, pension, rental properties) that cover all or nearly all of your living expenses? With such a portfolio I would hope it's the latter.

What is the investment thesis behind your fund selection here? Why these five funds?

Why no bonds? You are relying *entirely* on this 30% cash allocation to shield you from sequence-of-returns risk. What is your plan if and when interest rates decline? Your HYSA will no longer be HY and bond prices will have risen. Do you buy your bond allocation at a price premium? Or do you stay in cash and pray that equities are in a bull run and remain so? The term for this is the cash trap. It's best avoided with a proper bond allocation in one's fixed income portfolio.

There isn't enough information here to discuss taxes. Generally speaking, if you have a sizeable tax-deferred balance and you want to avoid or minimize RMDs then you probably want to devise a Roth conversion strategy before RMDs kick in. But there are many factors to this, such as your other income streams, your tax bracket, etc., so consulting a tax professional would be the best course of action for this. Software tools such as Boldin are another good option.

And then what? Do you need all these dollars in ten years, or are you beginning retirement in ten years?

> 1\. Is 6–7 ETFs overkill or is it good diversification?

It's overkill, not as much about the number of funds, but due to the redundancy of what the funds you mention contain. Have you seen **the** [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio)? It's not the count of *three* funds that's important, it's the three asset classes: Total US, Total International, and Bonds.

You already will own everything with VTI, VXUS, BND. ""Adding"" SCHD, QQQ, VNQ, SMH will *reduce* your diversification and introduce tilts, because they're *all* already contained in VTI.

> 2\. Does SMH make sense, or is it basically redundant with QQQ/VTI?

You don't need SMH. No need to tilt towards tech or semi-conductors, or [any sector](https://novelinvestor.com/sector-performance/), because sectors outperform in unpredictable ways and the market already has priced in all the available information about future expected performance. Tilting in that way tends to just introduce [uncompensated risk](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/), which means that you're taking on more risk than investing in a total market index fund, but you can't expect to receive better returns than the market average.

*Also*, you don't need QQQ. No one needs any concentration in ""the 100 largest (non-financial) companies that happen to trade on the nasdaq exchange"". It's a nonsense index. There's no fundamental reason for that selection criteria to outperform in the future, it only looks attractive because of the last decade of performance. It's only accidentally tech-leaning.

*Also*, REITs are contained in VTI at market weight -- some people do like to hold a REIT tilt, but you can consider it ""not necessary"".

*Also*, SCHD is unnecessary -- [despite dividend fandom](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/18m5g9t/comment/ke3lu4d/), [dividends are not free money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5j9v9dfinQ) (and, it's all in VTI already).",1755642208.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1mutfgi/monthly_investment_plan_any_feedback_will_be/n9m0n2m/

Semiconductors,Bogleheads,1m6brrc,"I'm 17 yo, and I want to start my journey in investing",n4jhclu,"I'm gonna give advice that's contrary to what others are giving. You clearly have an itch to pick stocks. History has shown that isn't optimal and that a broad market index fund outperforms stock picking and trying to time the market the vast majority of the time. 
  
It's awesome if you just take our word for it. But the key is that you believe it. If you invest in VTI but still think you could do better with stock picking and market timing down the road that'll bite you big time when you're dealing with larger amounts of money and decide to try it. 
  
So what you should do is invest at least half in VTI. Invest it as it comes in. Don't worry about market highs or lows. When you get that paycheck put at least half of the amount you were planning to invest immediately into VTI. With the remainder, go ahead and pick individual stocks. Attempt to time the market to your heart's content. Try to beat your investment in VTI. 
  
Then I want you to track those investments. In a year see how they stack up. In two years, see how they stack up. In 5 years, see which is winning. It's almost certainly going to be VTI. That should make you believe the boglehead philosophy. And trust me in the long run, being a 20 year old who understands and believes the boglehead philosophy but got sub optimal returns for a couple years from half of their portfolio is going to be way better than being a 20 year old who has been investing in VTI but believes they could do better by stock picking and market timing. 
  
Honestly the best thing you could do would be to invest fully in VTI but use a paper stock trading app to see how you would be doing by market timing and stock picking. You could even compare VTI to multiple different stock picking/market timing scenarios.",1753198004.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1m6brrc/im_17_yo_and_i_want_to_start_my_journey_in/n4jhclu/

If you're already funding a taxable brokerage account it might make sense to keep your money there. But, if the automation is helping you save more, then it might be a good thing to keep regardless.

2&3) yes, you are overexposed to small and mid cap stocks. Total market ETFs would help keep your risk profile where it should be. I'm assuming you want the small and mid cap exposure for potential growth? If that's the case and you want to be aggressive, you might consider Vanguard or Fidelity growth ETFs. Also, general advice here is that total market>individual sector ETFs. I don't hate the idea of you keeping those funds since they represent a relatively small portion of your portfolio, but most boglers would likely suggest exiting those positions.

4) You have ETFs in all of your accounts (except maybe Acorn again idk much about them and obviously not your CDs). When considering tax strategies think about how tax advantages would be the most beneficial. If you have a growth ETF that you're expecting to grow by 10x by retirement and a conservative ETF that may only double or triple, then having the gains from the growth ETF in a tax advantaged account will net a greater benefit. 

5) Red flags for me are the CDs. You already identified that they might be a mistake and I would tend to agree. They take away liquidity and tend to offer worse returns than ETFs. You are young with income and few liabilities, the safety of a CD is of little value to someone in your position.

My sincere suggestion is to sell all those assets as soon as possible and invest into some ratio of VTI and VXUS instead. I personally do 80% VTI and 20% VXUS.


The reason is that SCHD will create a lot of unnecessary dividend payments and your semi conductor ETF will add unnecessary volatility to your portfolio. VTI and VXUS are very low cost, broadly diversified ETFs.


Please also make sure to invest your money into tax advantaged accounts first before you invest into taxable brokerage accounts. The best for you would likely be a Roth IRA. You can invest up to $7000 per year without having to pay taxes on capital gains.

Dividends are not free value. Dividends are either neutral or a negative tax consequence.

Expecting higher returns from AI stuff is a bad choice because that is a wide expectation. Returns are based on performance *versus expectations*. When everyone expects big things, the big gains have already happened. Again, you’re chasing returns, which is a bad strategy.

One of the first things you'll learn as an investor is that the market generally has things like this priced in. In this context, other investors also realize that AI will continue to scale, so they've already bought into it and driven the price up. In short, for that investment to make sense, AI will have to scale even more rapidly than people are expecting, and expectations are already pretty high. IMO, it's not the worst choice for someone in your position, but it's a bit of a gamble and it's not in line with Bogle's philosophy.

Think about it like this. Say I have a one-acre farm, and people are investing in my farm at a price of $1. If I bought another acre of land, people would pay more to invest in my farm before I even started harvesting crops from that second acre, because they expect my farm to produce more crops in the future. So, despite me not producing more crops at that time, they would invest in my farm for more expensive prices; let's say they drove the price from $1 up to $2. If you then invested at $2, you wouldn't actually benefit when I begin to produce crops from that second acre, because other investors were already anticipating the output of that second acre. You would only outperform the broader market if I expanded my farm even more than what investors were expecting.",1751911180.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1ltxbet/25_yo_beginner_investor_just_started_with_1000_in/n1uheu3/

Semiconductors,Bogleheads,1l75pgi,Which approach is best for a 40 year investment plan?,mwu2z08,"I recommend VT! It's simple, requires no adjustments for a very long time (if ever), well diversified, and is low cost. It's 2 parts of the 3 fund portfolio in one fund. What it misses is bonds, which given your age, most people would suggest a range from no bonds to few bonds.

The only reason I can think of for keeping bonds in your Roth IRA at your age is that if you may need to withdraw contributions for some reason before retirement, say to buy a house, then the bonds will make your portfolio more stable (but probably also less growth). There are rules about how these withdrawals work, so you should investigate them if you think you might want to use it this way.

Semiconductors,Bogleheads,1kz0klp,For Americans: The famous first 100k ... does it include Roth Ira / 401k or is it pure stocks ?,mv1pmpm,"First, you’re attributing undue importance to a pithy aphorism. It’s trivially true that for any X “the first X dollars are the hardest.” That’s simply the inevitable result of compounding. It doesn’t make that milestone \*important\*.

Second, you’re confusing / misusing investment terminology. 

* Bogleheads typically invest stocks (ownership shares of a company) and bonds (promises to repay a loan by paying interest over a defined period of time then paying back the principal). Those are called asset classes because they represent distinct kinds of things that have value. Other asset classes would include things like real estate or commodities (precious metals, oil, grain, pork bellies, or most anything else with tangible value but that isn’t itself productive)

* When buying these assets Bogleheads generally prefer to invest in funds, legal entities in which multiple investors collaborate to purchase ownership stakes in multiple assets at once through the actions of a fund manager following a specific plan or prospectus. 

* Specifically, Bogleheads invest in funds that are passively managed which is when the prospectus calls for the manager to try to match the performance of an “index” representing the performance of a broad portion of a market, often all of it, rather than trying to pick specific investments in an attempt to outperform the market.

* The most common types of funds for Bogleheads to buy are open end mutual funds (typically just called mutual funds) and exchange traded funds (ETFs). The difference between these two comes down to how the shares are created, traded, and destroyed/redeemed and is has relatively little impact on a long term, “buy and hold” investor. (There are also close end funds used for investments like private equity investments that Bogleheads shun due to their fees and lack of liquidity$

* These funds can be held in a variety of different accounts, the distinctions between which are most commonly based on “tax advantage.” That is to say, various governments offer tax incentives to invest and save for goals such as retirement or education due to the socially desirable nature of this action, especially in reducing the need for government support in the future.

* Each kind of tax advantaged account has its own rules regarding contributions, how they are taxed, and how/when they may be withdrawn from. The most common names you’ll see thrown around have a bias toward the American tax code due to the population of the subreddit and would include 401ks, 403bs, 457s, 529s (all named after a section of the internal revenue code), Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs), and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). Those are just the common U.S. ones. In the anglophone world outside the U.S. you’d also run into Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs), Individual Savings Accounts (ISA), and Superannuation funds (Supers). All of these accounts can be compared to ordinary brokerage accounts without any tax advantages, often referred to as taxable accounts or just “taxable.”

* Within these kinds of tax advantaged accounts, in the U.S. there is a distinction between the type of tax advantage the government gives the account holder that is often prepended onto the name of the kind of account. When the government does not tax contributions to the account as income but taxes withdrawals as income that’s referred to as a “traditional” tax advantaged account since that was the first, and for a long time only, kind of tax advantage the government gave. In the late 1990s, Senator William Roth championed legislation to create a second kind of tax advantage in which the government would tax contributions as income but not tax withdrawals. These kinds of accounts became known as “Roth” accounts.

* Importantly, traditional and Roth are modifiers that can apply to multiple types of accounts including 401ks, 403bs, 457s, and IRAs. However, when seen in isolation, Roth is typically assumed to refer to a Roth IRA

So your question really isn’t actually valid: not only does it refer to a milestone that’s not actually important beyond psychologically, it’s conflating two entirely different types of things, asset class and the US-centric tax advantage type applied to a handful of specific kinds of tax advantaged accounts.

The question itself is a bit of a misunderstanding of what it is.

The 100k saying is just a thing people say to show has fast compounding works. The time it takes to get your first 100k will be a lot longer than 200k and so on and so on. It actually doesnt mean anything besides ""start investing early and consistently!""

>At least I'm aiming for the 100k in pure \*stocks. It's a long long time since I got that amount in my Roth Ira / 401k equivalent here in Europe.

I dont think most people are putting TONS in taxable investment accounts unless they are very wealthy or are really trying to retire early. Usually people if they aim to retire at 60 are fine just focusing on the tax advantaged accounts.

After paying that money into the system, I can't really regard it as my personal portfolio, rather there's just an accumulated monthly pension which I can track. That accumulated pension is however considered to fall under the constitutional protection of private property, so in that sense it's ""mine"".

If I work until full retirement age, the pension will easily support me, so in that sense I think of it as my core retirement income source and, I guess, equivalent to an IRA/401k for an American.

On top of that I have my private investments, which I guess are then similar to what Americans might have in their taxable accounts. Though Europeans have accumulative funds and ETF's which allow tax-free reinvestment of dividends, so if you buy and hold it works like a tax-deferred investment.

u/longshanksasaurs has explained the merits of the three-fund portfolio, the concepts of compensated vs. uncompensated risk, and the concept of a portfolio tilt and the need to hold a tilt for decades if you decide to do it. All of that advice is sound and you'd do well to learn more about it. But start by learning about yourself and your own appetite/aversion to risk, to make sure you have treated the question of asset allocation with the seriousness it deserves. If you aren't amenable to that kind of introspection and careful analysis, then you're likely best served by putting 100% of your portfolio into a target-date fund and letting the fund handle asset allocation and rebalancing for you.

Folks recommending therapists are spot on, and your self-analytical posts suggest to me you’d enjoy it.

The book The Let Them Theory has been having a moment, and while it’s super cringe at times, the value of letting go is communicated very well there. And the recent pop-philosophy book Meditations for Mortals by Oliver Burkeman may also help you be a bit more forgiving about noting and then moving on form these perceived “mistakes” like spending 10€ extra on a video game (I myself was annoyed but not hung up on “wasting” $2 by selecting the wrong discount code at checkout when buying some jeans last week).

I (43M) think some of the geriatric millennials (graduated undergrad university 2010 and earlier) and older here might be able to relate to the financial hopelessness given that we were your age or younger during the Great Recession. For whatever it’s worth, in ‘08 I left my first job at hedge fund to start a sometimes rewarding but extremely financially stupid career in nonprofits, government, and politics. I lost pretty much all my retirement funds and then made pennies for a decade. I’m doing ok now, but shitty compared to the numbers I see here, and that’s fine. We don’t need to be in the 99th percentile of people to be adequate. Knowing that no one really beats the market means that if I just follow that, I’m really doing the best I can. Any extra noise and high risk action I might take is just… like why would I do that when I can go practice musical instruments, read a book, or touch some grass.

I’m definitely projecting when I also suggest that looking at why non-optimization might trigger the anxiety could be worthwhile: as someone else suggested, breathing exercises and learning to observe feelings but not stew in them is a very good life skill. It’s not possible to control emotions, but it is possible to control how we choose to react with our actions, eg feeling a knot in your stomach and a bit sweaty at the onset of anxiety? Instead of choosing to punch a pillow and scream, we can choose to breathe in for 4 and out for 8.

I say that all to say I’m super impressed that you’re even thinking of these things at 29 and you’re likely way ahead compared to the rest of the population including your immediate peers. Give yourself some credit! And depending on local regulations where you are, finding a therapist to help process these thoughts doesn’t need to be super daunting, especially now post-COVID where telehealth is super common.",1741266774.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1j4hqbm/caved_in_to_a_world_etf_but_struggling_with/mgbnhr3/

You need a therapist and quite frankly I’m not sure how you will process what I say.  If you studied FIRE only to invest in shitcoin you either have a severe gambling problem or severe reading comprehension problem or a bit of both.  How can you study and read all the tenets of FIRE and invest all in on shit coin?  My mind tells me massive gambling problem. 

Let’s talk about what you’ve done right. You’ve worked hard at increasing your income which is amazing and should be congratulated. The markets are unstable and pulling back with more uncertainty to come due to someone who also is no stranger to gambling and willing to gamble with the livelihood of those that voted for him.  

This is a great time to get things back on track.  The market is on discount and you are earning income when you are still young. Sure you made massive mistakes. Learn from it.  You are equating your fear of crypto to your ETFs now.  Again is this a comprehension problem?  Do you understand how meme and tulip like crypto are (including bitcoin) vs equity markets?  Do you understand that the orange man calling for a US crypto reserve including alt coins is also what sent ripples of uncertainty through the equity market just due to how idiotic it is?

Younger folks have become more tech savvy and crypto friendly so it’s a well traveled mistake IMO.  It’s a mistake that has made its way up to the highest echelons of the current administration of the US if it makes you feel any better. 

When I was younger I mostly bogleheaded and left a small amount to my own whims to gamble with. I never did that well with the gambling portion.  My proportion of what I gambled vs what I bogleheaded created financial stability for my well off boomer net worth I have today.  I missed out a lot on crypto because I’ve always felt it’s worthless and still do despite being tech-minded(call me old fashioned but any currency that can be created from storage and lines of code just does not hold much long term persistent value to me even though I admit the latest and greatest evolution of it may).  I’m also just ambivalent to blockchain as well. There are a small number of tech bros that probably are financially way better off than me on their crypto bets, but I would imagine there are an army of folks like you setting themselves back trying to chase the lucky 1% gamblers. 

I have a higher risk tolerance for aggressive investments now than I did when young.  There is also just simple reasons why I can do what I do in my age vs what is ideal for you to do in yours.  It has always been the case that younger folks probably have less time and interest to check their daily CNBC and actively invest.  And that perhaps it makes more sense for them to find themselves, their careers, their love interests etc etc.  In terms of math and due to time and compound growth, what may be 5% play money for me for “gambling” can in absolute terms be 100% of your portfolio now.  It is understanding the factors and allocation of time, risk, for reward that constitutes if you are recklessly gambling or not, and not just whether you won the reward. 

Despite having more free time now (since quite frankly I haven’t been grinding my career as hard in my older age) if I had to be completely honest with myself I could still be a better husband, father, or employee if I also dialed back my interests and activity in markets.

Buffett likely remains confident in the long-term potential of the United States, which is supported by Berkshire Hathaway's significant holdings in American companies. It's important to distinguish between short-term portfolio adjustments and the core, long-term investments within his portfolio. These are simply my opinions based on my observations, and I acknowledge that I could be wrong. I'm not taking any of this personally. It seems you are focusing on specific details to support your own interpretation, and that's perfectly valid.

I see what it’s trying to do with VCSAX. By having SPY, SOXX, and AAPL, the original portfolio is heavily overweight in aggressive tech and growth, so it’s trying to offset that by diversifying into less correlated defensive value stocks. If the old holdings can’t be sold for tax reasons due to capital gains, I would probably use VTV/VVIAX, or better yet AVGV for global value, instead of VCSAX.

In adding badly needed international stocks, rather than just adding VXUS/VTIAX, it is breaking it up into developed and emerging and giving emerging markets an overweight. I think that, once again, because the original holdings are so heavily concentrated, it is trying to achieve better diversification by tilting to EM which is less correlated with US large growth and I agree with that idea.

When it comes to bonds, it really loses me.

This is one of over a dozen links I have that can help explain the reasoning behind that: 

* https://www.pwlcapital.com/should-you-invest-in-the-sp-500-index - invest in the S&P 500, but don't end there (this covers info on both the US extended market and ex-US markets) [a total US market fund combines S&P 500 + extended market into one]

US only is single country risk, which is an *uncompensated* risk: one that doesn't bring higher expected long term returns. Uncompensated risk should be avoided whenever possible. Compensated vs uncompensated risk:

* https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/

* https://www.pwlcapital.com/is-investing-risky-yes-and-no/ (Bold mine):
>Uncompensated risk is very different; it is the risk specific to an individual company, **sector, or country.**

Consider this instead: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio The bonds are the part that adjust risk level. More bonds equals less risk. Alternatively, a target date (index) fund is effectively the 3 fund concept in a single wrapper, managed for you.

Instead of going all-in on growth and semis right now, why not do it backwards? 

Keep Wellesley as your defensive core (it's actually perfect for the current high-rate environment with its bond exposure), and then slowly dollar-cost average into SMH over 12 months. 

Skip FSGPX entirely - if you want growth exposure, SMH gives you concentrated exposure to the exact companies that will power AI and tech growth, without the fluff that comes in broad growth funds.

Once you max out advantaged accounts its makes total sense to invest surplus dollars into a normal brokerage

Moderate vs aggressive tend to be buzz words to blanket needlessly complicated “look what I did for you” portfolios

Life insurance is about needs…do you have a family who is likely to survive you in the event of your death??  Spouse?? Kids??  Most people only need term; very, very rarely is whole or universal a “good” investment vs putting those premiums into stock/bond directly

If you happen to have a lump sum (like you do) the math favors getting it all invested asap; however investing isn’t 100% math.  Your life might be less stressful if you develop a 100k/week for 10weeks plan…..something you can stick with and won’t feel sick over

Focusing on business means you can afford to offput other tasks; being a good leader means knowing how to off load tasks (and to who).  Most big brokers have wealth managers; vanguards charges like 0.35%; and there are outside professionsals.  You’d want a fee only fiduciary; you can look at napfa.org

Semiconductors,Bogleheads,1g2xma7,ETF question,lrrr1f5,"> I have a lot of money in stocks in my brokerage account

Individual companies? Investing in single company stock exposes you to [uncompensated risk](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/), which means that you're taking on more risk than investing in a total market index fund, but you can't expect to receive better returns than the market average.

> have around $1,500 in my Roth IRA in VXUS and VTI.

**This is great**. That's total US (VTI) + total International (VXUS). That's all the stocks. It's the first two asset classes of the [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio)
of total US + total International + Bonds.

> I would plan on holding the ETF’s until retirement but would sell my ETF shares and put them in a different ETF if the current one is looking bad.

This is not a good plan. This is performance chasing (or market timing). You are unlikely to do better than the market average by trying to jump between different investments.

> The ETF’s I was thinking about is ITDH, SMH, and/or IEFA

ITDH is a Target Date ETF. Target Date Funds (TDF) are most appropriate inside a tax advantaged account, and could be used for 100% of your Roth IRA. Usually TDF should be 0% or 100% of your investment, i.e. you should either stick with what you're doing, or go all the way into TDF if you want the automatic rebalancing and bond glide path.

SMH is a semiconductor fund. The problem with that is you can't predict which fund will do *better than the market average* because [different sectors](https://novelinvestor.com/sector-performance/) outperform in unpredictable ways. So when you buy something like this you're actually just adding uncompensated risk again.

IEFA is a developed market fund. You already own all those companies inside of VXUS, so this doesn't add anything.

> Or should I not invest in these and invest more in VXUS and VTI?

Yup, that would be a great way to go.

The global market weight is about 60% US, 40% international, so that's a perfectly reasonable passively indexed asset allocation.",1728849588.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1g2xma7/etf_question/lrrr1f5/

>I would plan on holding the ETF’s until retirement but would sell my ETF shares and put them in a different ETF if the current one is looking bad.

That sounds an awfully lot like buying high and selling low. Don't try to time the market. Make a plan and stick to it

>The ETF’s I was thinking about is ITDH, SMH, and/or IEFA.

If you want useful responses, you really should say why you're considering these funds. Otherwise, responses will be generic. That said, ITDH is a 2060 target date fund. The big draw of TDFs is that they are the most set-and-forget ""Boglehead-approved"" option. If you want to use a TDF, it often makes sense to only use TDFs. Otherwise you're still rebalancing a bunch of funds anyway. Is 2060 around when you want to retire?

SMH is a sector fund (semi-conductors). Betting on individual sectors is an uncompensated risk. Why do you think the market is pricing this sector incorrectly?

IEFA is a developed market fund that excludes the US and Canada. Why do you want this in addition to something like VXUS?

Unless you have specific reasons on why you should diverge from the standard three-fund portfolio, just stick with it",1728850069.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1g2xma7/etf_question/lrrsj1k/

The problem with junk bonds isn't that the default rate is high: that's compensated by the yields they trade at. Their average performance over long timescales can be quite good.

The problem is that their default risk is correlated with the corporate economy. They tend to go up and down alongside the stock market, making them poor as a rebalancing pair.

Third, I would add in bonds other than JNK, as JNK often tanks along with the stock market, whereas one of the major benefits of bonds is that they typically move opposite of equities (not always the case, but typically) giving you a smoother ride, a better return on risk, and facilitates natural buy-low/sell-high whenever rebalancing every so often.

Semiconductors,Bogleheads,1faz79i,"SMH, VGT, VUG, & QQQ?",llxe78o,"Research modern portfolio theory. It might change your mind on bonds. It did for me.

The TL;DR is it reduces risk without reducing return. An asset class that works opposite your equities gives you much more flexibility than just equities in various markets. It will encourage buy-low/sell-high as you rebalance as they counteract one another, so you'll always be selling high and buying low, no matter what the market is doing.

The rule of thumb is your age in bonds (subtract 10 or 20 based on your risk tolerance, but bonds should be in your portfolio somewhere).

You're welcome to invest however you want to invest. Having nothing but absolute equities doesn't increase your return as much as you think it does due to the sequence of returns. On a drawdown year, bonds will keep your principle much better than equities, meaning the next bull run you start with a lot more principle due to that asset class which you capitalize on with a rebalance that you got to sell bonds high, and buy equities low.

Then re-read the Boglehead principles in the Bogleheads.org wiki including the 3 fund portfolio information linked by Cruian.

Then select the portfolio that works for your needs (3 fund, 2 fund, etc) and set your asset allocation based on the **risk you are willing to accept**. Google for the ""Vanguard Asset Allocation Models"" article and look at the graphic about halfway down. Pick the asset allocation whose downside fall you can stomach without abandoning the strategy. That tells you how much risk you are willing to accept.

Then pick a total market stock fund (either global or US dominant, different people have different opinions) and US total market bond fund (global bonds have a ton of risks) and set the allocation into the weighting identified by the risk you are willing to take in that graphic above.

Then calculate expected portfolio value after X years using your expected return rate using an online investment calculator. I like the ones at calculator.net they are super simple.

Then go plug portfolio value and other numbers into https://ficalc.app and run scenarios to see the success or failure rate of your investment from the time you retire until X years (30 years, 50 years, whatever) later. See how much your portfolio actually grows with FAR less risk and headache compared to your attempt to cobble it together yourself. See how much you can live on as a result. Change the number of years in the portfolio growth calculation or the withdrawal years on FICalc.app and see how early you can retire following this strategy without the headaches of putting it all together yourself the way you are doing now.

Then write it down in an Investing Policy Statement (IPS). Google ""you need an investor policy statement"" from Physician on FIRE to learn more.

Some people can handle the volitlity that comes from 100% stock, but others can't.

It is important to differentiate between good risk (compensated) and bad risk (uncompensated). An uncompensated risk is one that doesn't bring higher expected long term returns. Uncompensated risk should be avoided whenever possible. Compensated vs uncompensated risk:

* https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/

* https://www.pwlcapital.com/is-investing-risky-yes-and-no/ (Bold mine):
>Uncompensated risk is very different; it is the risk specific to an individual company, sector, or country.

So your VGT and your Mag 7 is uncompensated (bad) risk. I'd say that there's nothing special about the inclusion criteria for QQQ(M) that would classify that as compensated risk (what case is there to believe that which of the exchanges within the same country a stock trades on is a key component for future outperformance?).

Overall, your IRA looks like it is heavy on performance chasing (very underweight on ex-US, VGT, QQQM). Performance chasing can be said to be risky in that it has lower expected future returns (as what you're buying has alreayd had their prices driven up).

Performance chasing is a bad idea:

Semiconductors,Bogleheads,1dyr2kj,Am I taking on to much risk?,lcak5b1,"so no one can really tell you if your taking to much risk as that is a personal thing. If in a market crash such as 2008 or 2020 it drops enough for you to get emotional, panic, and sell, then the risk is too high. Ususally people think that can handle a lot more risk than they actually can. My best advice here is to back test things as far as you can. Preferably through a couple market crashes and carefully think through how you would feel seeing you accounts crash with various other situations stacked on top (Layed off? medical emergency?). Consider what might happen to you, would you be at risk of losing safe housing or lose food security? Can this risk be mitigated with something like an emergency fund or insurance? if so how big of a fund or insurance policy? Do your best to be honest with yourself. This can be really hard to do.

As for your allocations, at a glance i don't see any major issues (i.e. excessive allocation in single stocks).

They’re in essence the same thing, you’re just paying 2 different funds for it.

Vgt has pretty consistently outperformed qqq and idk why it would be different for qqqm, and qqqm also has a higher expense fee. .05 percent isn’t much, but it’s still extra you’ll have to pay out every year. Personally I would take that 25% and put it into vgt as well. Or replace that 25% with VOO, that way you’re getting bigger exposure to the non tech blue chips, and also getting huge exposure to them while they’re running at their highest.

Maybe drip qqqm into itself to keep harvesting better dividends, but there’s no need to continue splitting money between both.

That will result in permanent forfeiture of the loss -- i.e., you will never be able to use that loss to offset other capital gains.

The surefire way to avoid wash sales is to not sell at a loss. From what you describe, it's really just your Wealthfront account using TLH that could be doing this. It may be worth ditching for a simple Boglehead-style self-managed account that you could set and forget. That's honestly what I'd recommend here.

Barring that, you just need to stay on top of those Wealthfront sales and ensure that you don't have purchases or dividend reinvestment in your tax-advantaged account for the same or substantially identical securities within the 30-day windows.

I was with The Hartford, and that’s typical for them. My attorney explained that when the LTD insurance company makes the lump sum buyout offer, they’re considering the amount they have to INVEST to pay you over the years rather than the ACTUAL amount they would pay you.

Also, I learned that if the LTD company decides to cut you off (for whatever reason) and you hire an attorney to challenge them, you’re no longer squabbling over the total amount—it’s a fraction of that. My attorney said it can be less than what you’re offered in a buyout. That made me nervous and factored into my decision. It was a tough call, but I think the right decision for my situation. So far, my investments have done a little better than my LTD benefit, so it’s working out.🤞 It’s nice not to be under the insurance company’s thumb any longer.

Semiconductors,Bogleheads,1al98gh,To diversify or not diversify,kpdcuyf,"You are already diversified, but with some tilts and over/underexposures that don't line up with market caps. For instance, QQQM is already in VTI at market cap weights. So by holding both, you overexpose yourself to risk in those companies.

A well diversified portfolio would be something like the [3 or 4 fund lazy portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/How_to_build_a_lazy_portfolio).

Consolidating everything into VT or \[VTI + VXUS\] plus BND at your desired asset allocation would be a good idea to simplify your investments and balance everything out to market cap weighting. Whether it makes sense to sell your holdings to do so versus simply building your desired portfolio around them would depend on the tax implications of the losses/gains you might incur by selling them in your taxable account.

My suggestion would be to consolidate your taxable holdings into VTI, VXUS, and BND. Then use VT in your tax-advantaged accounts. This would allow things like tax loss harvesting, and be slightly more tax efficient. A target date fund in your tax advantaged accounts would be another option.

[This chart](https://smithplanet.com/stuff/BogleheadFunds.svg) will help you see how the total market might be broken down into its components, and how you might consolidate your holdings.

Hello there, excellent advise here from your side and regarding this quote from you, I am just wondering if this is truly the case for my example and I should apply that quote here as well. 

&#x200B;

For example, I got a ROTH IRA that is returning way less then the SP500 for example. It's a mutual fund (I literally got no other option besides that mutual fund for my ROTH IRA that last year, pulled in 11 percent return per year while meanwhile the SP500 pulled in 20 ish percent)  


Do you still believe, considering this, that I should focus on prioritizing my ROTH? I got an ETF that tracks the SP500 but that's my taxable account.

* Roths will generally be the last accounts accessed in retirement. Some of us will never access our Roth accounts because those funds will go to our adult children who will have an additional 10 years to withdraw after we die.

* So... since Roths generally provide the longest time-horizon, compound tax-free, and are tax free when withdrawn, Roths should be 100% stocks, IMO.

Investor return is primarily generated from the rare few companies which exceed expectations because return is all based on price. You don’t know anything about those industries and their growth potential that market doesn’t already know and hasn’t already priced in, so overweighting them is essentially betting that the market is wrong and their revenue growth will be far better than expectations. So your thesis for buying these sector ETFs needs to be not about sector growth but about why these sectors should grow exponentially more than people already think they will. And that is just not a game that Bogleheads play. Invest in the whole market and own everything and you will do fine.",1689787203.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/152qxa0/long_term_growth_etfs_thoughts_on_litbatt/jsm5bqw/
Semiconductors,Bogleheads,1443bfm,Allocation For 30 Year Old,jndm084,"I would ditch the semiconductor and AI ETFs. Betting on sectors is a form of active investing and you have no special information about why those niche sectors will outperform in the future relative to what’s already priced in (everything that’s already publicly known about them).

Also, SCHD isn’t a great pick either. It’s a more concentrated US equity fund than VOO (~100 stocks vs 500) with a minor tilt to dividend yield / value stocks. Even if you want that kind of tilt, which is inefficient in taxable accounts, you’d get better diversification and greater expected return by adding smallcap value to VOO instead of largecap dividend yield that’s pretty much just concentrating on a subset of the S&P 500.

80/20 VTI/VXUS would be better, but if you’re not from the US it \*really\* doesn’t make a lot of sense to overweight US equity. Even US investors don’t actually need any home country bias when their home market is > 1/2 the world market cap but it’s especially strange for a non-US investor to chase the US market. (Based on historical valuations, if you had to pick one half the world market for the next ten years it probably wouldn’t be the US; multiple expansion can only carry returns so far…)

I would honestly recommend a simpler portfolio with 60% VTI and 40% VXUS, although I still wouldn’t call that a “balanced portfolio” since it doesn’t include any bonds for volatility reduction.",1686221113.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1443bfm/allocation_for_30_year_old/jndm084/

If they're less than 1 year old, you'd be paying income tax rates on the gains. If that's acceptable to you, go ahead and sell.

>Should I sell the stocks I am currently invested in and purchase more of the Fidelity Funds I pick for the Roth IRA?

You may want to use different, but similar:

* ETFs are currently (at times) slightly more tax efficient than mutual funds

* ETFs are more portable than mutual funds

* Holding slightly different keeps tax loss harvesting in the future easier

>Also, would it be going against Boglehead logic if I bought a couple of ETFs for specific sectors I am interested in?

A small amount (usually 10% or less of the portfolio is commonly suggested) may be ok.

>For example, I work in the semiconductor industry and would like to continue to be invested in the sector if possible.

One common recommendation is to actually do the **OPPOSITE** of this: you don't want to have both your employment and an additional weight of your investments in the same industry.

Apple would represent about 9% of your portfolio, and Microsoft about 7%. Is there a reason you want to tilt even further toward the most concentrated holdings in VTI, other than chasing past performance?

>	if tech companies ever decline, QQQ will just rebalance the weights accordingly every quarter

Does that help if they all decline together, like sectors or asset classes like large-cap-growth trading at historically elevated valuations have a tendency of doing?

>	with QQQ, I feel it’s a more calculated risk as it’s the top 100 non-financial companies

That are listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Why should that be a basis of what to invest in, or suggest higher expected returns?

>	I can be conservative with my allocations by doing 50-60% (or even more) VTI and DCA-ing in.

Try to reframe your thinking. Ideally you’d start out holding the whole market (including international), and apply small evidence-based tilts, rather than starting from a concentrated portfolio and trying to fix that.

DCA only reduces volatility/risk during the brief DCA period, not long-term. Broad diversification is a better long-term way to avoid taking uncompensated risk (that which carries no expected reward, since it’s specific to your portfolio and can be diversified away).

Please don’t take this as specific criticism of you, but it’s posts like these that inspired me to create [this meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/Boglememes/comments/uaw22k/not_the_right_way_to_reduce_risk/) earlier today.

Fair points - I'd be willing to consider an international ETF, but can you share an international ETF that demonstrates your point (of international outperforming US in 2000 - 2009/2010 period)?

I checked IXUS, SCHF, and VXUS but they don't have data for 2000-2009 as they seem to have been established later. The 2 that I could find were VEA (Developed Markets) and VWO (Emerging Markets); VEA went from 51.52 on 10/12/07 to 21.24 on 2/27/09 (\~60% decline) and VWO went from 57.57 on 10/26/07 to 20.10 on 3/6/09 (\~65% decline), so not sure how that demonstrates your point. Maybe I'm getting something wrong...

Regarding QQQ+SCHG, what you're saying is definitely valid, \*but\* I feel like that risk is something that can be controlled by investing in both of them combined only conservatively or perhaps just one of them only conservatively. As I said in my original post, I feel like it's a \*calculated\* risk. Now, how conservatively we calculate that risk is another discussion and that depends on allocation percentages, but at least it's something that can be calculated and controlled by conservative allocations.

\----

Without international, something like this perhaps:

(1) 55% VTI, 25% QQQ, 15% SCHG, 5% SOXX

OR even more conservatively:

(2) 60% VTI, 25% QQQ, 10% SCHG, 5% SOXX

OR even more conservatively:

(3) 65% VTI, 20% QQQ, 10% SCHG, 5% SOXX

&#x200B;

With international, it could be something like this perhaps:

(4) 45% VTI, 15% VXUS, 25% QQQ, 10% SCHG, 5% SOXX

OR even more conservatively:

(5) 50% VTI, 15% VXUS, 20% QQQ, 10% SCHG, 5% SOXX

&#x200B;

Do any of these look good - perhaps (3) or (5)? Again, just a matter of calculating and controlling the risk - maybe I can be even more conservative by taking VTI or combined VTI+VXUS to 70%...

\----

But without an international ETF that actually demonstrates what you said, I'm still not sure how any international allocation lends a big advantage. I totally get leaning more heavily towards VTI and being conservative on the growth-oriented ETFs, but still not sure how international lends a big advantage especially because I feel like the world is far too interconnected now for any decline in US markets to not spill over to international markets just like it did in 2009. The world has only become more interconnected now since then. And I feel like most of the global markets (as a whole) now are only affected by macro events (such as the Ukraine conflict right now) that are bound to have some effect on the entire world's markets anyway.",1650874036.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/ubb2fi/hows_this_for_a_longterm_roth_ira/i63t5tr/

Replied with this\^ to another post, but curious what you think of these as well. If you had to pick 1 overall, 1 from without international, and 1 from with international, which ones would you pick? I still don't feel too enthusiastic about international (VXUS) - performance has been meager and abysmal for more than a decade now.

Also, what's the reason behind small-cap value? I've heard some people say it outperforms growth in the long run. Is that why or just for the sake of offsetting growth?",1650880162.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/ubb2fi/hows_this_for_a_longterm_roth_ira/i6409ay/
Semiconductors,Bogleheads,ubb2fi,How’s this for a long-term Roth IRA?,i64c4c0,"While I’m sure they exist, I don’t know of any EM fund outside of VWO, but you can check this out to see that EM was pretty consistently the top 1 or 2 performing asset class over the decade in returns: https://www.visualcapitalist.com/historical-returns-by-asset-class .  Additionally, similar to why large cap growth is historically the lowest returning asset class (due to how expensive its trading multiples are), America has this flaw compared to the rest of the world (America is about twice as expensive as the rest of the world), which also drags down returns.  Just think of Japan as well - I’m not saying that America is necessarily having a Japan moment, but if you’ve seen what happened to people who put all their eggs into the Japan basket in the 80s (ie, they only invested in a broad Japan only ETF which I don’t actually know if one existed but this is basically the idea), they’ve only just made their principal back in the past year or so - basically 40 years to break even.  A risk of putting all of your eggs in one basket.

You also have to understand that while backtests are cool, there are unfortunately no forwardtests so there’s no way for us to know which asset classes will be winners in the future, which is why it’s important for us to have broadly diversified portfolios.

I’m not sure what you’re meaning meaning how the risk of QQQ and SCHG is controlled, because for one thing 50% of QQQ is in SCHG, and they have a 0.96 correlation - so their performance is wildly similar. Again as well, large cap growth is statistically the lowest returning asset class (the market has strong expectations for these companies’ performance, causing the security to rise in price making it more expensive, and the more expensive a security is in the sense of its trading multiples, the lower its expected returns are) so it’s not like adding more large cap growth helps diversify this risk - it just becomes strengthened (I wouldn’t consider 30-40% positions of something to be a conservative allocation).

To me personally, i wouldn’t select any of those - too light on international for my taste and I tilt my own portfolio to small cap value which is historically the highest returning asset class (effectively, a reward for risk factors that are taken on) so incorporating large cap growth would worsen my expected returns.",1650888364.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/ubb2fi/hows_this_for_a_longterm_roth_ira/i64c4c0/

I personally tilt small/value based on the academic research, but there's also nothing wrong with holding just the market. If you are interested in tilts, check out this video by Ben Felix: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MVSsVi1\_e4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MVSsVi1_e4)

Semiconductors,Bogleheads,ri4sbm,Took the leap of faith and went all in on index funds.,howsncl,"Smaller stocks have historically had a better returns than larger stocks, although it may require holding for a longer period to realize that outperformance because it can be sudden and sporadic (eg in the aftermath of a crash). I am not so confident in the size factor that I will hold *only* small stocks, but I tilt to them by overweighting a small cap fund.

REITs (real estate stocks) have historically had returns comparable to the S&P500, albeit they have a much shorter history of data to work with - the first REIT index funds only came out in the 1990’s. But most important, REITs have had low correlation with the overall market (not always moving up and down together) so, when combined with a total stock market fund, a small allocation to REITs has provided better returns for the overall portfolio, although that gap has been narrowing in recent years with the explosive recent returns for large gap growth stocks (which is expected to be transient). There may be better ways of achieving this same effect, and academically they are not a separate asset class, but I think there is something special about them because they have a somewhat unique business model and dividend structure in the stock market. REITs got crushed in the subprime crash of ‘07-‘08 and their popularity declined substantially but I’m still a believer in their usefulness.

I think we’re talking past each other a bit here. 

Again, the BH approach would recommend against putting 5% of your Roth into, let’s say, a Canadian weed ETF because it popped last January and gave you big gains. 

Going a step further: Plenty of people here would just as strongly recommend against putting 5% into QQQ.

I get your overall point that projections are both imperfect, but necessary. A wise person (who works in quantitative analysis) told me once: All models are wrong, but some are useful.

Semiconductors,Bogleheads,p194as,Likely dumb question about tax implications,h8c2ues,"So, I'm not sure how much you know about how taxes are calculated so you may know some of this info already... (also I am not a tax expert so I could have some of these things wrong)

Let's use some easy numbers for this example. Say you have a 0% tax rate on long term gains from $0-$100k and 10% tax from $100k+, your salary is $90k, and you've sold stock/funds at long term gains for $11k in profit. 

$10k of your profits are taxed at 0%. This puts your income for the year at $100k so the next $1k of the profits are taxed at 10%. So I guess you do need to be conscious of where you think you will end up at the end of the year with regards to how much you will get taxed overall, but you will NEVER end up in a situation where you end up worse off in terms of total amount of money you are left with at the end of the year if you ended up in a higher tax bracket. That's a little confusing and I am not the best teacher, so lmk if that makes sense.

Selling losers to try and offset this is common, but that's different from tax loss harvesting. That's just taking a tax loss. Tax loss harvesting is specifically the strategy of selling an investment that is down and IMMEDIATELY buying another fund that is almost exactly like the fund you just sold. This doesn't count as a wash sale (look up wash sale rules for more info) and so you have reduced your tax burden for the current year, but have also lowered your cost basis (and thus will end up paying more taxes in the future). It can be advantageous to do this if you are a high income earner now and won't be in the future (early retirement, job loss, etc) when you need the money.",1628544667.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/p194as/likely_dumb_question_about_tax_implications/h8c2ues/

Semiconductors,Bogleheads,onmlcl,Need help restructuring portfolio With VOO as the core,h5sp6hk,"Ill tell you my portfolio as Im obviously invested in what I believe in.

VTSAX (VTI), VIGAX (VUG), VGT. Another 5-10% in single stocks like tesla that I bought a while ago and just holding.

I recommend VTI over VOO due to its exposure to small and mid cap, and you are buying the entire US Market. This portfolio has tons of exposure to tech, take that as you will, but tech is huge right now and takes up a big part of value and growth funds.

I dont have international because of what jack said - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P54trh0Rre8&list=WL&index=78](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P54trh0Rre8&list=WL&index=78)

Semiconductors,Bogleheads,onmlcl,Need help restructuring portfolio With VOO as the core,h5vo63g,"Depends on how you want to think about bonds. I prefer to take more risks on the stock side. On the bond side, I aim for safety and volatility reduction. An unhedged global bond fund would add volatility rather than reducing it while a hedged bond fund has costs/friction associated with hedging. I'm not *against* holding international bonds I just don't see it providing the same kind of diversification benefit - more important is just holding some kind of stable fixed income (be it Treasuries, Total Bond, CDs, cash, I and EE bonds, or some combination). Stocks are a different matter - hold the wrong subset and you can miss out for long periods (e.g. Japan for decades, or US in the 2000s, etc...).

My own default recommendation is actually VGIT - a pure shot of Treasuries - rather than BND. But they overlap a lot, so NBD. BNDW is also fine. You can trace out how they do during stock downturns or other scenarios and you'll find they're more similar than different, but often Treasuries do best when people are fleeing equities (with the caveat that TIPS might do better than either in a situation where equities are suffering and inflation is rising). Every downturn is a bit different, though, so I do recommend charting out what does what (or has historically).",1626791875.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/onmlcl/need_help_restructuring_portfolio_with_voo_as_the/h5vo63g/

Really long-term Treasuries shot up somewhere over 30% (though I'd be careful with those - great in a typical downturn, but very sensitive to rate changes) before coming back down as stocks came back up.
