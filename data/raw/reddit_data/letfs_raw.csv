nhkh65p,"Very few people stick to a strategy, even when the results are pretty clear. Everyone thinks they can time the market better or pick the winners, so they don't stay the course.

As for LETFs in particular, these are fairly recent inventions in the grand scheme of market history. The US in general has been on an epic bull run for over 10 years now. Will it continue? Who knows. Your question is something I've wondered about myself, though. There is a prevailing narrative around the dangers of these investments that seems quite overblown relative to the actual risk/reward. People tend to get hung up on the fact that a 2x or 3x LETF does not provide \**exactly\** 2x or 3x returns over time, which to me is irrelevant if the actual returns still far exceed the alternatives. 

I can think of several other more dangerous forms of investing (or gambling) that are somehow considered ""safer"" by the masses. Our community here is TINY compared to nearly every other investing subreddit. I would not be surprised to see LETFs embraced more by the mainstream in the decades to come. All it will take is for a reputable, respectable public figure to point out some of the things we already know to be true.",1759507944,73,LETFs,1nx359x,/r/LETFs/comments/1nx359x/genuine_question_why_do_all_leveraged_etfs_show/nhkh65p/
nhkpjuf,">Personally, I hold TQQQ in my portfolio, and I'm following 200sma strategy and somehow I believe that this over long-term can provide. But it also makes me think: why don‚Äôt more people follow these strategies if they‚Äôre so profitable? What am I missing here?

Because they are risky, more than some people realize. TQQQ had impressive returns over the past decade, thanks to a period of ultra low interest rates (negative in some countries, if you can believe it) and the absence of a deep recession. But the world does not always look like the past decade. If you had invested in TQQQ in the early 2000, after 25 years you would not have yet recovered from the dot-com crash. If you had invested in TQQQ following the sma200 strategy you would have recovered from the dot-com crash after nearly 20 years.

nhkoxcc,"There are a multitude of reasons.  I‚Äôll go with the most common ones I can think of:

1. Not everyone is an investor like us. There are many ‚ÄúVOO & chill‚Äù types. They might put their money into QQQM, or SPMO.. but they just drop it into a ‚Äúdiversified‚Äù ETF of some kind that tracks the market or sector and call it good. Some people might pick a few such as SMH and VOO.  Let‚Äôs not forget many people are focused on ‚Äúdividend only‚Äù type of investments. There is nothing wrong with either of the above types - everyone is different. 

2. Not many people like the idea of having to actively manage their portfolios and understand the market movements. That means what ever strategy you choose - you have to stick with it. Personally I like to use trailing stop losses and then enter back in once it crosses north of whatever moving day averages it went south of. 

3. Not many people took the time to understand leverage and the risks. Robinhood presents a warning on leveraged products.  Most brokerage‚Äôs require you to sign agreements about ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù products such as leveraged. On top of that many ‚Äòdoom and gloom‚Äô kind of folks talk about drag and decay, and see a chart showing a draw down and that causes many people to walk away. 


Not to mention many people just don‚Äôt have money to invest, don‚Äôt invest, or go with some financial firm that tells them what to do with their money (even if thats the company 401K plan).

nhm2qg1,"For starters, most people simply don't know. The dominant mainstream financial wisdom is ""VOO and chill"". Or Boglehead 3 or 4 fund portfolio. Or high-dividend funds (ü§Æ).

The second thing, hand-in-hand with that, is the prevalence of ""time in the market beats timing the market"". Even in this sub, you'll see a lot of advocating for buy-and-hold portfolios, *maybe* rebalancing. Actually getting out completely, or rotating, just seems to not be popular, despite the self-apparent advantages when you actually look at the data.

This is one of those cases where the ""wisdom of the crowd"" simply doesn't hold up to scrutiny.

**Evidence outweighs opinion.**

As long as you're looking, I might suggest considering/testing other timing models, like 40-week instead of 200-day. Slightly slower reaction, but that ends up being a good thing sometimes, by avoiding whipsaws. There are other techniques for doing this, like a % padding. Also, consider asymmetric exit and entry (get in on the recovery). Also consider different behavior after a spike (covid, tariffs) than a true bear market (2022).

nhkvgkx,"I have had LETFs for two years. That's not long in the span of investing but in that time I am running 10 percentage points ahead of the S&P.

There are a lot of reasons people aren't in LETFs. Some of them are good reasons and some are silly. 

* Some LETFs are not good investments. Single security, 4x, and 3x on anything but the S&P is riskier that its potential reward warrants in my view.  
* Even great LETFs are extremely volatile. That's part of why they work but many investors can't handle the volatility of unleveraged funds. LETFs are too spicy for their risk tolerance. 
* Professionals aren't comfortable recommending them so there is limited uptake. Even though I think there are great LETFs I don't recommend them to people because of volatility, fees, and the additional barrier of understanding how they work.
* There is a major criticism of LETFs that they are hobbled by volatility decay. My read of the literature is that this is a very real phenomenon, but it varies by LETF weather the decay is worth it or not. Because of the decay not all indices can support leverage, but the S&P and Nasdaq can. 
* High fees. Worth it imo but not an invalid complaint. 
* There is an extra layer to rebalancing because you have to figure in your leverage ratio along with your allocation percentages. 
* If you are unlucky with your entry time you could end up behind the market for a long time, even if it works out over 20 years.
* Not necessarily worth it for someone nearing retirement or who already has a well-funded retirement account.",1759512034,3,LETFs,1nx359x,/r/LETFs/comments/1nx359x/genuine_question_why_do_all_leveraged_etfs_show/nhkvgkx/

1. Most letfs were introduced past 2009 which was just after the last major stock market crisis. In fact were currently on the longest lasting bull run in the history of capitalism. Letfs do well in this scenario

One thing I'd like to add: alpha doesn't get eroded because none of these strategies have any alpha, it's just extending the CML. If anything, Sharpe slightly decreases to the first order (assuming a parabolic shape of growth/vol). Retail investing with unbounded weights under various utility functions is by the way a solved problem since the Merton problem from the 70s, and arguably by Thorp already in the 60s when it comes to leverage. The big-name quant firms of the world are all after risk-adjusted returns, which they scale to whatever volatility target the client wants. Assuming market-beta itself is indeed a structural market-factor with long-term growth, it follows from an elegant mathematical proof under quite minimal assumptions that leveraged ETFs *must* outperform in terms of log-wealth, so it's as surprising as ""1+1=2"".

nhl7ewn,">Who lump sums without adding or hedging downside into LETF though?

Hedging sometimes helps, sometimes it doesn't. This is the S&P500 vs UPRO vs HFEA (UPRO hedged with TLT). Hedging helped in the 2000s, not in the 1970s when both UPRO and HFEA took almost 20 years to recover from the 1968 crash. Hedging or not, anyone using leveraged strategies should be prepared for the possibility of enduring multi-decade drawdowns.

No way.  Each cash input generates a new CAGR starting that date, and each 200 on average has become 30k over 15 years with TQQQ. Only if I was about to cash out big would that change. 
As far as ""the big plan"", that is the Holy Grail, I've been backtesting different ideas for more than ten years.  Most rules-based hedges erode returns instead of protecting them, which defeats the purpose.  I'm currently live testing a monthly decision hedge that is not MA-based but is rules-based.

Regarding the DCA and portfolio value‚Ä¶Not at 10k. I mentioned by 2% total annual contribution of the total portfolio value. Which is 260k portfolio with 200 bucks biweekly. My apologies if I wasn‚Äôt clear. 

Running that at 30% cagr‚Ä¶.At that point it‚Äôs adding 990k after 15 years‚Ä¶about 7% of the 14.3m instead of the 13.3m. 

The cagr is going to have slippage though because the daily target pricing isn‚Äôt going to be perfect. But assume that it does. 

It‚Äôs probably better at that point to just hold the cash and purchase when there is a correction or crash as an annual exercise. Or enjoy life a bit more and not contribute if it‚Äôs causing strain elsewhere if you can live with just 13.3m in 15 years instead of the 14.3. It‚Äôs a personal choice at that point.

My second thought was hope that modelling works out for the different signals instead of moving average. My plan is to deleverage by a percentage at a specific dollar value and/or at retirement age, keep virtually cash for a 2 year run, part in lower risk ETFs and the remainder in the leverage.

But I took early retirement and do not have lot of capital, so my main goal is preserving the capital than getting outsized returns.

nf3js1a,"This isn't the worst idea. Like I considered it myself and I'm in my early 20's. I instead opt for a diverse portfolio for a couple reasons not immediately obvious. My portfolio averages 1.4x leverage which returns much less over a decade than holding QLD. However, considering I will be adding a signficant amount of money every month for the next decade from my job and running a monte carlo simulation, I found that the median senario only put me about 6 months to a year ahead after a decade of investing by using 2x leverage. In addition to that, looking at the bottom 20%, my portfolio outperforms by double in the worst case senario. 

So if you're adding a lot of money to your investments regularly, and your timeline is about 10 years, QLD might not be worth the risk/reward over mixing up investments in a way that minimizes the worst case senario.

I went on buyupside and did a backtest.

Starting Aug 1999 through August 2006

1000/month

So I used ULPIX and compared it to SPY.  
ULPIX: 95,085 (17% dca growth)

SPY: 97,576 (20% dca growth)

  
So in this case DCA spy did slightly better, however, for a 2x fund, you can DCA through the dotcom bubble and be fine. 

  
and if you were to continue DCA 1k/month through the 08 crash you'd have to DCA through it it was brutal but by like 2013 or 2014 you just outperform SPY.",1755729161,1,LETFs,1mt3mel,/r/LETFs/comments/1mt3mel/friend_is_100_in_qld_and_made_a_good_argument/n9slqmr/

n9bkswp,"I'm studying this and following you, looks like a solid strategy for LEFTs.

Few questions I have for mentality -

1a. do you have any other portfolios (fun port, diff strategies)?

1b.  How do you resist the temptation to have a little side port with single stocks vs sticking only to the 9sig?

1c. I assume you don't play around with options at all? Even possibly selling covered calls on the TQQQ position for bit of extra money?

1d. Do you run this on taxable, ROTH, or both? If one or the other, do you have recommendation for the other non-9sig port? (ie. if this is in your ROTH, what are you running on taxable, and vice-versa?)

Other technical questions:

2a. If TQQQ goes down 1%, you'd buy in what it would have been if it had went up to 9% (ie. start with 100, you'd expect 109; it went down to 99 so you'd buy 10 more), did I get that correct (so you calculate fixed goal for next quarter as you rebalance)?

2b. in the above scenario, does the 9% expected increase go from the current (99) value or the expected (109) value? Assuming the former is correct, 99x1.09 = 107.91 is the next expected value?

2c. With compound growth ie. bull market, do you expect the original 60/40 to grow to more like 90/10 and beyond? Or does it go the other way around, in bear market becomes more like 90/10? I guess it depends but if it's hitting close to the 9% each quarter then it'd be increasing; if significant surplus, ratio decrease; if significant deficit ratio also decreases? Just trying to wrap my head around it, I guess this strategy doesn't really care for absolute ratio than the 9% growth?

2d. ~~For the 30 down rule with the TQQQ strategy, are you looking at SPY, QQQ or TQQQ? It's based on 30% fall from ATH like a trailing stop (but actually don't sell right?) Does it kick in instantly or based on the rebalance date?~~ For 9sig, look at TQQQ based on highest previous 2 year quarterly price, so it may mean different for different rebalance dates, only kicks in at the quarterly rebalance date.

2e. In the 30 down rule, ex Q1 rebalance 100 goes to 70- are you buying 39 to get to the expected price set in the prev quarter? and then skip the next sell quarter (if Q2) and then Q3 (or after sell quarter if it doesn't happen Q2) reset back to 60/40 of the total port?

2f. In the above case of 30down, from Q1 70 to Q2 let's say doesn't go up much, only 5%, then buy rule is triggered (target 70x1.09= 76.3, actual 73.5) so we'd buy 2.8 more, correct?

2g. What if it actually goes negative (let's say -1% so 70 x.99=69.3) then we'd be buying the difference which is 7, and resetting the baseline to 69.3x1.09 for the next quarter?

3. Are there any other rules than the basic 9% and the 30down? I don't think I've seen others mentioned, maybe if you provide some keywords I can keep digging (if you explain it here that would be awesome too).

4. I saw couple google sheets on kelly's website for 3sig, do you have any resources for the 9sig?

 first, its fees inefficient I believe 50% TQQQ and 50% QQQM would be better.

Third, hedges don't just decrease volatility but also increase returns (you can see this here https://testfol.io/?s=241voZ4o1pD ) even better for you is that that optimal leverage amount is a function of CAGR and volatility so decreasing volatility would allow to achieve higher returns as then your optimal leverage value would increase.

mu6hbht,"You really should be utilizing hedges instead of solely relying on QLD performance. I promise I can convince you if you read below.

The main reason that most people are mentioning is the drawdown, which can be absolutely massive. It‚Äôs a completely different thing to see a 90% drawdown in a backtest and say ‚Äúyeah I can handle it‚Äù vs in 20 years seeing all the money you‚Äôve saved go from $3 million to $300K. Many people, including potentially your future self, which you truly don‚Äôt know yet, would sell or deleverage and miss out on a bulk of the recovery.¬†

Another issue with large drawdowns is that during the drawdown is the most likely time that you could be laid off from your day job, which means you could be forced to pull money out of your portfolio at the bottom of the market. By using a hedged strategy with lower drawdowns, this action will still hurt returns, but not quite as much as 100% QLD.¬†

While 100% QLD has large drawdowns, you might still say ‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll sell any, I just want the highest returns‚Äù. However, using a hedged strategy isn‚Äôt just for reducing drawdowns, but it can actually increase overall returns as well. You can actually use TQQQ instead of QLD to achieve similar leverage, but have more space for hedges to further reduce drawdowns and increase returns.

1. Past performance generally refers to relatively smaller time periods, like <30 years. Longer time periods give us reasons to think a particular asset class has a higher or lower expected return than another asset class.

That minimizing the uncompensated risk of individual companies, sectors, or countries while keeping the same expected return can only be achieved by buying every firm at its market cap weight is a common conclusion of our best financial theories (with factors and otber stuff as well).

mw5q8dt,"Look at the rolling returns and you will see that it is very similar most of the time, with some periods that quarterly ended up out performing and some that yearly ended up outperforming. This is purely due to the luck of the timing. This makes sense because if you are overweight equities and your timing is lucky and rebalance at the top of the market, then you won't experience as much of the drawdown. Alternatively, if you are underweight equities and rebalance just before a large drawdown, then you will experience the bulk of the drawdown but won't be able to buy the dip because you can't rebalance for a year.

So while yes, the S&P500 has historically been just slightly better when timing the rebalancing for the end of the year, this is entirely based on chance and is different depending on what index you are looking at. For example:

67% isn't terrible odds especially since that's getting at least twice the return. You can do this but you'd need to be disciplined in doing the same amount of money (not shares) each month (some brokerages let you do recurring on these others don't). It does match up with that NDX graph you posted where you don't want to go over the 2x leverage. 

You could do say like 10% of whatever you allocate a month to saving and then buy the regular SPLG/SPY/VOO , you're probably too young for fixed-income like bonds so that would be small too. You just want to be diversified in different assets/sectors/industries etc. at least for the current environment. I'm not sure we're going to see anything like the concentration in a few megacap stocks for awhile at least. 

There's a lot of different ETF funds for almost anything that probably will get better returns over the long run compared to how long you would want to hold this. Remember compounding starts to take off and really build momentum so if you're investing young that 2x leverage might not even make that much of a difference to you entire portfolio return.",1745180673,1,LETFs,1k3snuq,/r/LETFs/comments/1k3snuq/is_buying_3k_worth_of_qld_or_whatever_setamount/mo5a1th/

None of the portfolios have an overall leverage of 2x. This would mean 200% exposure.

m7privv,"Imagine a 20-year-old who begins DCAing into TQQQ with every paycheck during a bull market. By the time they‚Äôre 30-32, their portfolio could grow to $1-1.5 million‚Äîa reasonable sum, though not extraordinary depending on where they live (e.g., California, NYC, Seattle). Now, imagine a 30% market crash causing TQQQ to lose 80% of its value, reducing their 10-year portfolio from $1.5 million to $300k. Such a loss can be very difficult to digest, making it difficult to hold through the downturn. Crashes are often accompanied by job losses or other income reductions, further making things worse. Starting over after 10-15 years of effort is pretty bad. 

A better approach might involve starting with leveraged investments like TQQQ early on, but gradually reallocating to less volatile assets over time, such as unleveraged ETFs or even high-yield savings accounts (HYSA).

Now, consider an alternative scenario: after 10 years, the investor has $700k, allocated as $150k in TQQQ, $50k in HYSA, and $500k in VOO. In a 30% market crash, the leveraged position would drop to $30k, the VOO allocation would shrink to $350k, and the HYSA would remain at $50k, leaving $450k.

Also I say this because I'm in my own fence-sit: valuations are extraordinarily high in US markets and with the uncertainty of the new presidency and any economic tiffs that may result, there's significant short-term risks that make caution more valuable now than, say, in 2021.

To put that in real numbers, suppose the SP500 has been on a bull run, and you have made 5x your initial LETF investment while a non-leveraged position might have made 2x.

Of course, this is the extreme case of volatility decay, but it illustrates the potential downside of such an investment strategy. In a prolonged environment of stagflation, volatility decay can eat away at a lot of value.

Despite the downside, there are a few reasons leveraged ETF is appealing or even recommended.   
1. Portfolio theory recommends taking on slightly more risk than what a traditional 100% stock/bond portfolio affords for young investors. Leveraging unlocks that additional risk profile.  
2. For investors who believe they can time the market (because of genuine knowledge, hubris, or insider info), LETFs let them capitalize on that belief.

mnlspbh,"That's actually a nice summary. I can provide more details.

If you keep increasing leverage to infinity, volatility decay statistically causes the chance of ruin to approach 100% but the average wealth will keep increasing forever. This is sort of a mathematical feature of the way LETFs work, but a simple analogy in plain words is the Saint-Petersburg paradox. 

>The Saint-Petersburg Paradox is a problem in probability theory where a game involves flipping a fair coin until it lands heads, with the prize doubling each time. The player pays a fixed fee to play, but the expected value of the game turns out to be infinite, even though the price is finite. The expected value calculation shows that the sum of all possible outcomes, weighted by their probabilities, results in an infinite number: E\[Value\]=2/2+4/4+8/8+‚ãØ=‚àû. Despite the infinite expected value, most people are unwilling to pay a large amount to play, leading to a paradox in decision-making theory, as it questions why a rational person wouldn't accept a game with such high expected rewards.

In that same mathematical framework, you can do an optimization to find the ideal amount of leverage for median wealth, which turns out to be around roughly 1.5x-2.2x leverage for equity. The formula can be derived based on the return and volatility of the underlying using the *Kelly criterion,* and we also see it empirically if we simply backtest equities with varying amounts of leverage and pick out the best backtest and leverage ratio. However, this is an optimization for *log-utility* (aka the CAGR), but is not necessarily ideal for an actual investment. The risk appetite, investment horizon and liquidity depends on the specific investor's situation, meaning we are also interested in risk-adjusted returns. If we truly were emotionless and very illiquid robots that just wanted as much money, everyone should be Kelly investing. This is why we generally define different utility functions to be optimized for various investors. For this reason, we changed from the old CAPM to the *interporal* CAPM (ICAPM) in the 70s, and incidentally also explains why there are more market risk factors at play than just market-risk.",1744905658,17,LETFs,1k1482v,/r/LETFs/comments/1k1482v/what_am_i_missing_it_seems_that_letfs_would_be_a/mnlspbh/

l9b3ptk,"Some thoughts in both directions:

I see pre-1913 as too different of an era for comparison to be valid.

The US currently regime change in 1971 makes comparison before then dubious as well.

Modern market innovations like circuit breakers should prevent total destruction as in 1929

That all said, I think the take-home of this is valid. I went through one day and ran sims from every five year interval through to present with different leverages. 3x relative performance to unleveraged was high variable. It could be radically underperforming or overperforming. Some underperformance stretches were lifetimes. Even when 3x was high, the paths in and out were ugly. I don't think 3x is a good buy and hold position. Personally I hold some 3x now to ride the bull but I will exit when the bull tires.

What's unsaid here is that if you include 2x it totally demolishes 1 and 3. 2x wins most time periods, and even when it doesn't it is usually in a comfortable second place. It rarely underperforms unleveraged but when it does it is brief.

l9ba1zy,"Not a valid argument.

No current or future market will ever look anything close to 1885 or even 1920.  Buying and holding at a lot of entry points *after* the Great Depression significantly outperform SPY.

Most importantly, people aren‚Äôt looking to buy and hold UPRO for 100+ years.  Not a *single* person is doing this.  They are buying and holding for many years or decades, DCAing over many years of decades, and doing so with the hope they have a chance at selling for a large profit at some point.

Everyone who invests in 3x LETFs and holds ‚Äúlong term‚Äù is really just willing to hold for decades to get a chance at taking profits during a run like this.  The whole point is to take profit at some point when UPRO is massively outpacing SPY, even if it‚Äôs 15+ years from now, not to hold for 150+ years past your life expectancy, or even hold 50+ years when you may be dead by then too or, if not, too old to even enjoy the $.

3x LETFs are also a bit of a gamble.  A lot of it is just beta. People know there is a chance they might underperform SPY and are happy to take that risk for a chance at outsized gains/taking profit.  

Given how big beta is and how big the uncertainty/variance is for future expected returns, I would say it‚Äôs hard to even conclude UPRO has underperformed over this period *in a statistically significant manner* in the sense that the two have not diverged enough relative to alpha and beta such that URPO can‚Äôt simply *outperform* SPY from 1885 to 2030 if we just wait a few more years.

UPRO, a 3x VOO ETF, has actually outperformed the 4x SPYU at 136% upside. Note that UPRO has also lagged the leverage target (3x 50%).

Obviously there is volatility drag, it's just overstated by those who think LETFs are too risky, and understated by those who never experienced high volatility. There is an efficient leverage so that you don't experience a lot of volatility drag and can hold through high vol periods, and it's probably slightly less than 2x.

nha2g3t,"LETFS are not the ""holy grail"".
LETFs are not the ""holy grail"" or a get rich scheme. They are dangerous and bring lots of risk into your portfolio. I know this from experience. I've seen my portfolio rise to its peaks, then to see it all come crashing back down. I've been in TQQQ since 2017. I've seen the drawdown of Q4 2018, Covid crash of 2020, and the ugly year of 2022.

The biggest thing I've learned from being invested in a LETF is being able to control my emotions. You can run the backtests, use the 200 dma, technical analysis, or however you choose to trade. My advice is to find a plan and STICK TO IT! Too many ppl bail out on their own convictions when things get tough. We are talking LETFS, things will get tough and test your patience.

Don't worry about if someone is buying the same day you are selling or sold for more profit than you did. They may have a totally different plan than you. Comparison is the thief of joy.

The one plan i don't like is the idea of buying a LETF thinking it will only go up after you buy it. That is a horrible plan. Ppl see a stock going up and think it will just keep going.

m7gq1zg,"I look at the 200MA for the underlying of the leveraged ETF. So for example for UPRO that would be SPY and for TQQQ that would be QQQ. Websites that I use is basically yahoo finance (you can also just look at the chart in your brokerage account. I'm with IBKR and also do that, but I like to read the forums or some news on Yahoo finance so that's a bit of my go to). In the morning (or during the day) I basically look at where SPY stock price is and where the 200 MA price is relative to that. You can see this in below table for SPY (200MA right now at $557.12) vs. current SPY price at $592.43 which is quite a bit higher so I just hold the LETF UPRO (=3x SPY).

The same approach for my TQQQ holding => QQQ 200 day mA right now is 478.41, current QQQ price is 516.52 so again I hold TQQQ.

The point where I would sell TQQQ would be when the price of QQQ (1x) would go under the 200 day MA of 478.41. However, as there is sometimes volatility in the sense that it may dip slightly under the 200 day , just to move up again an hour later or something and it being a 'false signal' does exist. To avoid that I actually exit with a -2.5% buffer relative to the 200 day MA., so only at 466.74. I apply the same principle for re-entry (+2.5% above the 200 day MA) to prevent back and forth oscillations when the underlying hasn't made a clear move in either direction. Right now, QQQ itself would have to drop -10.67% before I would get out of TQQ into cash at which point I would have suffered a -32% drawdown, but still maintain the majority of the investment.

This may sound like a lot of work if you don't check the markets daily, but it isn't. Also now with QQQ being about 10% above it's 200 day MA, unless a significant cash happens all in one day you don't really need to watch this every minute either and one can use a stop loss also and set it at your exit price for TQQQ which would be -32% from current price.

There is someone that did extensive backtesting and found that based on 200SMA with the buffer , one should on average trade not more than about 1.3 times a year (or less) so that buffer principle seems to work.  I have also monitored the 50 day SMA and 100 day SMA to see if those would lead to better capital protection (drawdowns) and how it may give wrong signals (for example going all out when below 50 SMA just to see the market go up). The 200 SMA seems to be most solid but has the downside that one would likely already have seen a 40% drawdown or so before you cross it. Now imo that is better than the 90% one can see from a long term buy and hold, but for some still too much. it is a bit how you balance behavior vs. upside staying in mkt. As said, I have now observed 3X UPRO & TQQ as well invested in 2X QLD and SSO for a few months and it seems that for 3X leverage it may be an option for example to take out 25% at crossing of 50SMA, another 25% at 100 SMA and the remaining 50% at 200 SMA going into cash (same principle when you cross over /above again). This would enable you to gradually take money out and in case the signal was 'wrong' and it goes back up, you still have 75% or 50% riding. For 2X LETFs (QLD/SSO) I think one can apply the same but may be less necessary as they are less volatile. As said, I am developing my strategy/approach further and am mainly focusing on trying to preserve capital from huge drawdowns. For that I am thinking of coupling this to the Fed Fund Rate (FFR) and taking more of the table (reduce exposure to 3X or move it to 2X or cash) based on the level of the FFR. This is based on a study done by a forum member and posted a while back. Below a picture of the conclusion in terms of ideal leverage based on cost/FFR. I like that  idea as I have looked back for SPY leveraged 3X since 1928 and each time FFR went above 5% 3x tended to show very poor results and one was better off being in 2X or if FFR went higher even 1x or cash.

I think that is why lots interpreted it as them banning 3x leverage funds, it is more or less overexaggerating Rule 18f-4 and while yeah technically we won't see the creation of new 3x leveraged ETFs because of all the strict requirements involved that discourages companies to create them, it is not banned. The current ETFs though are grandfathered in though, but honestly there is no need for new 3x leveraged ETFs we got everything we need, a 3X QQQ and 3x SPY and 3x tracking other industries like SOXL and TECL.

mlu6oou,"UPRO & TQQQ forever
I’m curious if anyone can give me a good reason why I shouldn’t just DCA into these two ETFs forever. I’ve been investing in them for about 5 years and I’ve done great. Was down almost 70% in 2022 but it all came back because I didn’t panic sell. I know how they work and I’m comfortable with the big daily swings. I know there’s leverage decay over the long run, but if you look at historical returns they still do about 2.5X what their underlying indexes have done. Once the dollar amounts get larger in the future I’ll diversify more. The only thing that scares me is if there was some freak market event like Covid and everything dropped off a cliff and these triple leveraged funds get liquidated. It’s happened to other triple leveraged ETFs before and a few when Covid hit and the market tanked, but I think it’s far less likely to happen with UPRO and TQQQ since they’re the largest triple leveraged ETFs. Give me your best reason why I shouldn’t DCA into these forever and get 2.5X normal market returns.

Edit: I’d like clarify that I currently have about $500k and do this with half of my total portfolio. The other half is diversified in SCHD, BTC, HDV, VOO, etc. The money that I’m putting into triple leveraged funds is long term money that I won’t be touching for 10 years+.",1744019263,1,LETFs,1i2ogu4,/r/LETFs/comments/1i2ogu4/letfs_are_not_the_holy_grail/mlu6oou/

To test the effect of DCA with periodic inflation-adjusted contributions. I stepped through a sequence of periodic contributions on a fixed duration to calculate an end portfolio value after 5, 10, ..., 25 years. I create a sequence starting every five days.

The good news is that the ending value was always larger than the sum of contributions.

As one might expect, the extremes for the sequences went 3x > 2x > 1x, and the deviations increased with the length of the contributing period. A substantial fraction of the sequences ended up with a fairly similar total regardless of leverage.

For a five-year period, about half the starting sequences favored LETFs and half favored 1x. The odds gradually began to favor LETFs with longer investing periods. By 20 years, 2x beat 1x around 75% of the periods. 3x beat 1x around 60% of the periods and beat 2x around 25% of the periods.

The winning and losing relative to 1x tended to be in extended periods of several decades. 2x and 3x tended to produce similar results prior to 1970 and diverged afterwards. The period since the 1980s is not representative of earlier periods.

Let‚Äôs say you lose 100% and have 0 dollars left.

If you DCA 1000 a month it will either be 1000 or 1010 at that point. Doesn‚Äôt really matter.

My point was mostly, if you use risk parity and the 5x s&p goes to zero (a big crisis), you have paired with bonds (or gold, etc etc) that will move up during a crisis.  

You then have 0 left in s&p but say 5000 in bonds/gold. 

You rebalance that to 2500-2500 (a sort of DCA within the portfolio itself) and therefore it becomes possible to go higher then 3x leverage. 

The overall results increase drastically and with much lower risk.

Try to play around with the numbers, based on the competition winner of s&p/bonds/man.futures

I am not saying leverage is bad.
I advise you to consider it carefully and realistically though.
First you might want to add a 2-3% drag per 100% leverage on top which are the costs for borrowing.
That will change the outcome quite a bit.


Then you have to consider what happens to your sanity if your wealth is obliterated in a +90% downturn with 3x leverage.


Human beings very quickly get accustomed to situations.
Loosing almost all of the wealth you got used to have will hurt way more than you can imagine now.
You are not a robot, you will get emotional.
Right now leverage us popular after that insanely high bull market returns and the low cost of borrowing.


Go and find somebody that invested in 1998 like your backtest implied and kept on holding on full leverage the whole time.


Don't underestimate this and the catastrophic outcomes it could have on your sanity.

ma2q2g8,"Volatility decay hurts more and more as a function of Sharpe. The lower your risk adjusted returns, the larger your volatility decay.

A couple useful equations: Geometric growth \~= arithmetic return (AR) - volatility\^2/2. Since AR is just Sharpe\*volatility + Rf, excess CAGR turns into volatility\*(Sharpe - volatility/2). Sharpe & diversification become increasingly important the more levered up you are.

Second is the Kelly-optimal fraction. This is essentially ""What is the max leverage you could take on an asset with expected return & volatility assumptions (normally distributed, which is a big caveat) that would also maximize CAGR?"" That is, to say levering beyond that point, volatility decay would decrease returns by more than the extra expected returns.

The Kelly-optimal fraction is arithmetic return/volatility\^2, or Sharpe/variance. Thus a .3 Sharpe & 15% volatility strategy would be Kelly-optimal at .3/.15, which is 2, as you said. However, there's a saying ""You never go full Kelly"".

Now if you can increase expected returns while scaling volatility as a lower rate as a result of diversification, you can vastly increase all the numbers. For example, a 50/50 combination of two .3 Sharpe strategies with zero correlation becomes a .42 Sharpe strategy. So instead of Kelly-optimal of 2, Kelly optimal becomes .42/.15, or 2.8. That is to say with increased diversification, you can push things further before volatility drag overwhelms the higher expected returns.

Take this to extremes, and you can start doing some pretty wild stuff.

I personally run my own portfolio at 4.6x leverage, though it's realistically much higher than this if you count leverage embedded in funds. It hits about 25% vol, which by my calculations is about half-Kelly optimal. If you back this out, it means my expected total portfolio Sharpe is ~.5. This is broadly based on fairly conservative assumptions.

All this is to say that increasing diversification through multiple uncorrelated assets allows you to push leverage further, and leverage allows you to take full advantage of the diversification potential.",1738269764,8,LETFs,1idutyg,/r/LETFs/comments/1idutyg/letfs_rebalance_drag_everyone_should_read/ma2q2g8/

ma5v37z,"[u/dbcooper4](https://www.reddit.com/user/dbcooper4/)

Assuming you're not trolling, it would be interesting to see your explanation as to why an underlying asset (VOO) has no volatility drag.

Here's my guess as to your thought process, starting with the standard method to explain volatility drag:

If SP500 returned daily: +2%, -2%, +2%, -2%, the average return is zero, but the actual (""geometric"") return is 1.02 x 0.98 x 1.02 x 0.98 - 1 = -0.08%.

For a 3X SP500 leveraged fund tracking these 4 days, the average return is also zero, but the actual return is 1.06 x 0.94 x 1.06 x 0.94 -1 = -0.72%.

I'm guessing you would say: the 3x fund lost more than the SP500, and this is the volatility decay.  In other words, the volatility decay for SP500 is \*defined\* as zero.   Now the rest of us know the real definition: Volatility decay or drag is the fact that -0.08% is less than zero in this scenario, or more precisely the real return is less than the average return.

Of course if we start with the definition that 1X asset has zero volatility decay, imagine a 0.5X ""deleveraged"" fund. With the above 4 daily SP500 returns, the 0.5X leverage fund would have a real return of 1.01 x 0.99 x 1.01 x 0.99 - 1 = -0.02%. Since -0.02% is less of a loss than the underlying asset loss of -0.08%, does this mean there is some sort of volatility ""thrust"" with a 0.5X ETF?

Here's is another guess as to how one could conclude that the volatility decay for the underlying ""asset"" (e.g. SP500) has zero volatility decay:  You only first heard about volatility decay or drag in context of leveraged funds. Since you haven't heard about volatility decay in books/forums/articles about stocks or the SP500 or unlevered assets, you concluded that it doesn't exist for them. Of course there is a logical fallacy: just because you haven't heard about it (for them), doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

In fact, you have always seen volatility decay with 1X assets; you just didn't realize it because it wasn't given the same name.  All investors will eventually notice this same fact:  when the SP500 drops 50% in say a year, it takes 100% gain to recover, not a 50% gain. (Note average of -50% and +50% is zero.) This is the same principle as volatility decay.

I suspect on this matter your mind is made up no matter all the evidence and logical reasoning to the contrary.  It reminds me of flat earthers.  And it's really annoying to argue with flat earthers about the earth.",1738310293,4,LETFs,1idutyg,/r/LETFs/comments/1idutyg/letfs_rebalance_drag_everyone_should_read/ma5v37z/

Volatility drag is just another way of explaining the gap between arithmetic and geometric returns. Every asset has this property.

From the article: ""Variance drain is the mathematical fact that an investments compounded return is always less than or equal to its simple average return. The gap between these returns widens with higher volatility.""

Compare a 50% VOO position to 100%. Et voila, volatility drag.

nib2spa,"Daily reset leveraged products work best when there is very little volatility and an upward trend. QQQ has exposure to 100 stocks, with the top 10 holdings having 50%+ of the exposure. S&P 500 has 500 companies, with top 10 holdings of 39% exposure. Still bad for the S&P 500 if anything goes wrong with those top 10. But the point here is that you take on more risk with more concentration, and concentration is not a compensated risk generally. If LEFTs suffer from the volatility of stock movements, and QQQ has performed extraordinarily well lately, nothing lasts forever. When that tide turns, will the volatility be minimal enough to retain your previous gains, long-term? This is why some LEFT holders, myself included, don‚Äôt trade TQQQ for much of their portfolio, and instead leverage up a less volatile fund, like the S&P 500. It is a more predictable product in that regard. The goal in that case is to take ‚Äúsafer‚Äù products and leverage them to minimize the volatility decay. TQQQ has been better lately, but when this trend eventually reverses, it‚Äôs unclear how much the drawdown can go, when you account for the 3x drawdown + volatility decay. Even if you had 1000x profits and held in the dot com era, TQQQ would have still gone to near zero, with a 99.8% drawdown. If using concentrated ETFs, stop losses are appropriate, especially if you do have substantial gains. A risk considerate approach would be to take some gains off the table, park them elsewhere, and if you insist on holding TQQQ long term, then use those other funds to buy back into TQQQ in such an event. But this strategy carries substantial risk.

Testfolio for TQQQ, QQQ, UPRO, SPY, with $100k starting capital, held through dot com, for 20 years. Trimmed the last 10 years to better visualize the drawdown. TQQQ recovers some in this period, of course, but behind QQQ. That backtest gives TQQQ a few years to grow to be generous, and is well over 7,000% return before the dot com bubble hits, and it‚Äôs wiped out. Hence the need for stop loss, collateral, diversification, or DCA.

Tail risks - we all underestimate them.

My point is that leverage exposes you to downside risks, and compounding it with higher volatility which is expected for less diversified holding - even S&P over all US market, or all US market vs. global market, only increases the exposure - more so for selecting NASDAQ vs. S&P, even more so for selecting Magnificent 7 or specific single stocks.

So I came across 3MST last week. I dipped my toe in this week starting with 125 shares at ‚Ç¨17 and dca'd down to ‚Ç¨12 with now today 1750 shares. I even bought some at the lows :)

Now I have been reading the prospectus and can't figure out too much other than the fee structure and the recommended holding time (1 day). 

I expect the btc price to rise the coming week(s). How long to you recommend me to hold my position? You all obviously seen bitcoin explode from 75k to 83k today and mstr is up ~25%.

While historical data is important, you cant have your cake and eat it too. Past performance does not guarantee future performance, that cuts both ways (historically spy outperforming). Things change, monetary policy and tech companies have led to a different fundamental picture then the previous century so it is not necessarily the case that we return to the mean from before these things caused such a shift.

The outlier being technological improvement like we have never seen before the last 20 odd years, with profit margins to match. More money in the system then ever before and not many places to put it besides the largest companies which are continuing to show strong growth.

Also good to consider the passive investing flows that are continually pushing the market higher, and more stock market participation then ever before.

Markets cant be efficient if its either priced in or a burst. Its either efficient and therefore things are priced in, or its inefficient and we see these inefficiencies as bursts.

m45k8vi,"No not really, everything I stated was factual. Also it being not completely efficient automatically disregards your argument. ""inefficiencies exist due to¬†**information asymmetries, transaction costs, market psychology, and human emotion**""

""the periods of outperformance will always get priced in""  
""because market efficiencies and market fundamentals simply do not allow it.""  
""Market inefficiencies this big...""

Everything cannot be priced in if markets arent efficient, and if they are not completely efficient then they are by default, inefficient. Markets are played by multiple participants, all with varying levels of information and emotional states.

Inefficiencies exist because it is not efficient, so assuming that any and all inefficiency will be priced in when by your own admission inefficiencies are present thus they are not all priced in. If anything, the things being ""priced in"" are constant fed support, large profit margin growth by biggest tech companies (which make up 30% of spy and qqq) and passive income flows from ETFs. That all points to a continuation of the new trend of qqq outperformance, not a return to an outdated mean with a substantially different fundamental back drop.

The sub prime mortgage crisis has nothing to do with the monetary policy and tech advancement we have seen since the GFC - s0 no, bankers were not saying what I have been saying. And even then, if they were, they were right. After the GFC, QQQ continued to outperform. Funny that....

The financial systems strains are alleviated by fed intervention, which does not seem to be going anywhere anytime soon. The only thing that would collapse is the US dollar - and a lot of that inflation is asset inflation....hence the stock market appreciation.

nfrshwb,"I don't know. I assume smarter people than me have figured it out for some hedge fund somewhere, but just...watching stuff over the years...50? Maybe...100?...yeah probably, I know at 1000x the DCA wasn't even changing the tenths of percent on the positions return.

Now arguably this is the same thing, but now with more tools available to invest in, I'm not all upro/tqqq like I was back in the day. I have FNGU, NVDX, USD, GOOX, GLGG, probably two dozen other similar positions. Splitting the DCA into all of them, keeps the individual position sizes smaller, and even though it's a smaller DCA, because that's also getting split up, it's allowing more of the month-to-month nuances of the market to demonstrate momentum.

Does that make the actual overall portfolio any different? Maybe, maybe not. Guess that depends on who excels the most for the longest period of time. Something a little more motivating about seeing a change though when I keep it at 100x or lower, just so you can actually see changes.

Edit to add. I read your post wrong. I thought you were talking portfolio size over monthly DCA amount, so with your 100k/month I'd say it stops being a meaningful DCA after about 100x that, at which point I'd want to be out of margin.",1758637260,1,LETFs,1no8c5k,/r/LETFs/comments/1no8c5k/letfs_as_dca_and_hold_forever_strategy/nfrshwb/

I use MLPR (1.5x Alerian MLP index) as my energy exposure. It's done more than double the market since its inception in June 2020.

I do find TYO interesting. It's only a little under the market performance-wise, but it's almost completely uncorrelated (0.26).

mppw5qa,"I agree to a point but the concept of buying at the ""bottom"" is something that is only obvious in hindsight.    

Many current market participants believe that a 20% drawdown will always get bought and therefore might start bottom picking there - if they were to face another 20% drop after that they might lose conviction.

Each time we face a new crisis (the great financial crisis, Covid) it can seem like the world is ending and we have never faced anything  like this before (e.g. its different this time)    

And then the market rallies and everyone in hindsight is like, of course that was the perfect time to load up and ride the wave back up.   

Making decisions like that isn't  so easy when you are looking at the hard right edge of an index graph and there are lots of head fakes that makes it look like a bottom is in only to sell off again and hit new lows.

Next, you need to look at how the daily rebalancing impacts you. If VOO were to go up 1% then down 1% (UPRO 3% both ways daily) and do that for 10 days in a row you‚Äôd end up with the overall market fund VOO being down 0.05%. UPRO would be down 0.45% or 9x VOO.

Choppy trading amplifies the decay aspect of daily rebalancing. Now pretend this happens for roughly 250 trading days where the market is bouncing up and down daily but relatively for a trading year. VOO would be down 1.24% overall plus 0.03% fees so 1.27% while UPRO would be down 10.64% plus 0.91% fees so 11.55% overall so about 9.1x worse than VOO.

m6gunm4,"It's definitely not a science for me. It really depends how many dips I buy and my cost basis becomes. Once I turn green overall, I start to think about averaging out based on what's happening in the market, economy, my own life, etc. In the last few years, I bought TQQQ numerous times on the way down in 2022 and I started buying around $75 all the way down to about $20. My basis got to around $40. I started to cash out in early 2024 when it got into the mid $50's when I was up about 20-25%, which is right around when QQQ was hitting a new all time high. Normally I would have started selling a little earlier. I kept scaling out every few percent increase on QQQ and then because I felt like the market had just run way too much, too fast post election I decided to sell the last batch around $80 towards year end.

There's no magic formula for me, it's mostly convert from 1x to 3x on meaningful declines and then take profits on the way up. I've seen much longer bear/flat markets than we've had recently so I don't have the risk tolerance to just DCA forever and hope we avoid another Great Recession or Dotcom bubble. For me personally, I've done well enough that I'm starting to enter more of a capital preservation phase personally, so leveraged funds are starting play less of a role.

Sorry for the roundabout answer, probably doesn't help much. I guess the moral is don't be afraid to lock in profits on these funds and don't get overleveraged. Good luck!",1736542844,1,LETFs,1hwtnlo,/r/LETFs/comments/1hwtnlo/someone_help_me_understand_danger_of_letfs/m6gunm4/

m9sohf6,"It‚Äôs easy to beat the market in the long run. Asset class returns look much less volatile when you zoom out.

Timing the cycle entirely can be hard, obviously nobody knows what every asset class is going to do at any time, but accepting market risk,  pursuing premiums where available, and avoiding investing in systemically losing tools (I keep having to harp on this subreddit about how buying options is like buying insurance) makes beating the market marginally very easy (subjectively / imo - subject to survivorship bias).

Gold and commodities just don‚Äôt provide good returns. Spot prices just don‚Äôt keep up with CPI, and commodities futures returns are driven by swings in the curve and rebalancing - again, predicting short term things is tough.

Regarding gold and commodities as a concept, since you don‚Äôt like data: 

1) We just don‚Äôt need that much gold to make useful things. A huge majority of the demand is just jewelry and investments. If you‚Äôre going to bet on the world collapse and needing to smuggle gold and diamonds across the Mad Max desert, just buy ammo.

2) Commodities are the engine for everything else. The price of commodities is too cyclical not only due to the reality of markets but due to speculative investors who don‚Äôt know how they work. It‚Äôs hard to grow sustainably. And everybody except the producers want cheap commodities. People are price sensitive to them because they are cost inputs. They‚Äôre generally undervalued and we won‚Äôt know what we got til they‚Äôre gone. When they‚Äôre gone, again, you may as well buy ammo. The purpose of commodities futures is supposed to be so airlines and other businesses can survive shocks to the business cycle by hedging.

As you‚Äôve pointed out gold occasionally gets higher returns. Occasionally somebody will be concentrated in gold and meet success via fortunate timing.

I‚Äôm not counting on that. To me, gold has low long term returns because it‚Äôs a speculative asset instead of a productive asset. I‚Äôll let my systematic wins add up over time and beat 99% of gold bugs.

Is that satisfying enough? As for what you‚Äôre looking for in an asset, there are many asset clssses listed in a comment above which you can review.

10% of gold is used by central banks. 10% is tech. 80% is jewelry and speculation. I don‚Äôt really give a hoot if central banks hold gold. I believe generally that productivity is more important than abstract government systems in regards to asset returns.

You probably won‚Äôt be shocked to learn that I don‚Äôt hold LETFs long term.
