Tech,ETFs,1ofypf5,NVDA to SMH ETF,nllbi4m,"Just a couple of things to note: I personally don't think long term investment horizon is considered 5-10 years in the investing world but maybe i'm not a popular opinion. To me long term is more like 20-30 years. I'm curious to know why you are only investing to a max age of 31 years old?

That aside, I would offer a suggestion for FTEC or VGT in replace of SMH. I think it gives better exposure to the tech sector. Additionally, expect a max drawdown with your current portfolio to be around about 60-80% due to the overexposure to tech with a core holding of QQQ and SMH (25 stocks all in tech). Sure you can get the higher return but conversely can get hit with a higher loss.

With an investment horizon of 5-10 years I can't reasonably expect a recovery from a massive tech fallout. Volatility blows are softened with longer time horizons and diversification and I personally don't think 5-10 years is enough to recover from a volatility blow should fall victim to one. Take a look at how long it took the US Market to recover after the 2002 ""dot com"" market crash followed by the the 2007 financial crisis.

[(US Large Cap Stock Market) versus (Total Global Market))](https://testfol.io/?s=cHy15uzNU8w)

The blue line on the graph is how a portoflio globally diversified is doing from 2000-2025 and the red line is how a portfolio with only the top 500 US Companies is doing from 2000-2025. 

Notice the S&P 500 falling behind the Total Global Market after April 15, 2002 and never recovering to it's lead until around June 26, 2018. Due to the crashes of 2002 and 2007, a portfolio concentrated only on US Large Cap companies was not making as much money as a portfolio that was globally diversified for a total of 16 years.

With this in mind, bear in mind the realistic possibility of your portfolio tanking and not recovering for 15+ years. This is well over your time horizon of 5-10 years. If you are still okay with that volatility I would recommend holding your positions for 20-30 years to ensure a higher likelihood of getting a positive return on your investment and then moving your portfolio value to much more stable positions.",1761535190.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1ofypf5/nvda_to_smh_etf/nllbi4m/

Tech,ETFs,1ofypf5,NVDA to SMH ETF,nldjwht,"I've been thinking a lot about this too because I love NVIDIA too, but my thesis is this (I'd still be happy to discuss it because I'm not so sure):

Nvidia is the leader in AI GPUs and I believe its moat is so large that in 5-10 years it will still be the leader in AI and will continue to grow incredibly.

BUT based on the law of large numbers, even if companies like AMD or Intel fail to even match NVIDIA and NVIDIA continues to be the undisputed leader in the sector, I believe that these companies, just by the fact of being considerably smaller companies, have more potential for growth in the value of their individual shares by a greater percentage than NVIDIA, purely and exclusively because NVIDIA is so big that making a 2x is much more difficult for NVIDIA (even if it remains the undisputed leader) than for AMD (even if AMD never even manages to match NVIDIA).

That is; I'm not diversifying into Broadcom, Intel, AMD, etc. because I think they'll beat NVIDIA in the long term (in fact, I think NVIDIA will be the winner), but because I think the growth potential of these companies in terms of share valuation is greater than NVIDIA's, because NVIDIA is already enormous.

Likewise, what I like about this 70/30 split is that almost 12% of my portfolio would still be exclusively NVIDIA, so I would still be capturing the growth of the winning company either way.

Likewise, I would be delighted to hear your opinion because I am a little undecided and perhaps the debate could clarify the situation for me.",1761427339.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1ofypf5/nvda_to_smh_etf/nldjwht/

Mathematically, I agree with your thesis. ETFs have the overwhelming advantage, they are flexible and adaptable. They can adapt to changing market conditions. Maybe there is some company that doesn't even exist yet, but SMH can buy that company, 10 years from now in the future. Your numbers check out, and I think your plan has a high chance of success. I agree with everything you said about the potential for growth. 

I am approaching it from more of a behavioral question. I don't claim to have the answers, but I like to ask questions like: How do our human brains deal with concepts like risk-tolerance and the unknowable future? How does the experience of owning ETFs vs. individual stocks affect us, emotionally and behaviorally? Why does the decision to take decisive action sometimes feel very different than waiting to see what happens?

If you want broad market exposure:

If you chase returns and load up on what’s hot it might kill you in a market bubble.  Also, I would want to know your International % of your portfolio. Personally I think diversification into International is more prudent than owning a bunch of SCHD. So the proper response is …it depends on the rest of your portfolio.  I own a ton of SCHD but it’s less than 10% of my total portfolio. I plan on holding until next reconstitution and see what happens but I also own a lot of growth already.

Tech,ETFs,1ob92sw,Thinking about selling my SCHD position,nkjx466,"That’s an interesting opinion and can’t wait to see it peer-reviewed. I doubt anyone reasonable will start believing dividends will regain their relevance because of this white paper.

The Tweedy Browne paper you cited isn’t proving dividends are inherently superior, it’s showing that over very long historical periods (100yr), companies with high yields often overlapped with other factors like value and quality. Even the authors admit their results don’t hold consistently over shorter spans, and the data is largely a proxy for broader factor exposure, not dividends themselves.

By contrast, the foundational Dividend Irrelevance Theory (Miller & Modigliani) is clear that in efficient markets, a companys value is determined by its total return - earnings power and growth - not how that return is split between dividends and price appreciation. Whether you receive cash or reinvested gains, the total return is identical.

And that’s exactly what the last few decade has borne out. Dividend focused strategies like high yield ETFs and dividend aristocrats have consistently lagged the broader market, especially growth and innovation driven firms that reinvest earnings rather than distribute them. Investors who focused on dividends left a large amount of return on the table compared to those who simply captured total market appreciation. And the companies that issue dividends aren’t innovating. A dividend is just a forced sale, tax drag, and performance drag. 

So yes, the ability to pay a dividend may signal stability according to someone, but that doesn’t make dividends a superior “tool” for compounding wealth. The only thing that matters to an investors outcome is total return",1761022414.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1ob92sw/thinking_about_selling_my_schd_position/nkjx466/

Stop loss and risk management is definitively not the same as market timing. Are you sure you've actually read any of the research done on market timing and diversification? There are many excellent papers on portfolio theory that describes very well why concentration can be great long term.          

> qqq isn't diversification, it is concentration     

I am not saying that QQQ is more diversified either, in fact I am arguing that it is a good investment exactly *because* it is not as diversified as VTI + VXUS. My point is that diversification is not an optimal goal for a 22 year old to base their investments on.

Tech,ETFs,1ob6wl1,Is this good? 22 y/o 20-30 year horizon,nkg979g,"Compounding works best with higher returns and lower drawdown, not lower beta. Beta is just a measure of volatility. If an index only goes up and never has a single drawdown period, but it's rerurns are three times as high as vti, it will also have a higher beta then vti. Does that make sense to you? Do you understand why a lower beta is not allways the optimal strategy for everyone?               

Modern portfolio theory does not support VTI+VXUS as the defacto investment for long term investmemmnt, nor does it support broad market indices as the best diversification tool for every strategy. Several papers support broad market indices as a *defensive tool*, but not the optimal tool for maximum risk adjusted returns in all scenarios. My argument is that diversification is not a good goal for someone this young, because it is too defensive. I've read several papers that compare different indices, but never like you present this argument. I haven’t read them all, though, so I'm open to being wrong about this. Modern portfolio theory is also very much based around the investor risk aversion, which is not adressed in a portfolio that captures the entire market.      

The gain in risk mitigation, however, between a qqq index fund compared to VTI is negligible in the long term if you go beyond 15-20 years, which is what OP is asking about. If reducing the beta is the goal, adding non stock assets is more efficient, so why are you recommending VTI+VXUS if diversification is the optimal goal, in your opinion?          

No academic evidence on stop loss and other risk mitigation strategies? Are you sure about that? There is an entire field of study on risk management within the field of investing.           

You seem to be very set on diversification, but you've failed to give an argument based in fact as to why that should be a goal for a 22-year old? If their risk adjusted returns are higher by concentrating more, why would they go for 0.04 lover beta when they can potentially double their returns with more concentration?",1760952049.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1ob6wl1/is_this_good_22_yo_2030_year_horizon/nkg979g/

VT is the one true set if and forget it ETF that I would advise most investors to do. Its the less stressful, least intensive, and just as effective portfolio composition. 

Any other portfolio composition other than VT will require much more attention to global markets, annual rebalancing, and just overall more attention and opportunity to fail.

With VOO, or another S&P 500 index, you're buying into the top 500 companies in the US.  They're the top companies because they do well.  Companies like that can weather storms and continue to perform well even when market conditions might have other companies struggling.

Tech,ETFs,1o86t58,ETFs to hold for another 30 years,njv5qny,"i get what you are saying. The numbers dont lie, but context is everything. I would say you struggle to see the appeal of VT because the U.S. has been on absolute BULL RUN for the last 20 years. Correct me if im wrong but we are in the one of the longest if not the longest bull runs the United States has ever had. 

The appeal of diversification and specifically VT is in bear markets and after a bear market cycle. 

VOO doesn't capture mid caps or small caps. Keep in mind VOO is the best for stable earnings but not for earning POTENTIAL. The ceiling for Large Cap 500 is already at an all time high and consistently tries to push for more to meet quarterly expectations to maintain their stock holders. When companies can no longer live up to growth expectations they begin to weaken or have to collaborate or buy up smaller companies. Think of OpenAI and AMD right now. 

However mid caps and most especially small caps have WAY MORE POTENTIAL. They have a higher ceiling to reach than Large cap companies and can be where real investments shine post bear markets. 

Market crashes and bear markets can ""reset"" markets and those that survive the wake of a crash and recover well can make it to the top. That includes small caps and more likely mid cap companies. Large cap companies have limit to what they can grow and reach before crashing out i.e. Enron, Toys R Us, Radioshack, Sears, Kodak, Blockbuster etc. 

If you buy up mid and small caps via VT, you can lessen a blow to market crashes, and bolster your recovery from bear markets. 

All this is hard to fathom because well we haven't had a true crash since maybe 2008. S&P 500 has been killing it for the past almost 20 years so the data suffers from recency bias.",1760649707.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1o86t58/etfs_to_hold_for_another_30_years/njv5qny/

My best simulation of this data would be to create a total world market fund split of 60/40 US/ex-US with funds that go back far enough. So I did. I used VTSAX for total US Market and VGTSX for total ex-US market and place that portfolio dating back to 2000 up against SPY.

[https://testfol.io/?s=cHy15uzNU8w](https://testfol.io/?s=cHy15uzNU8w)

from the years 2004-ish through Q2 of 2018 you can see that a total market stock similar to VT would have been beating SPY (VOO). SPY was underperforming an All world portfolio for 14 years. You can also see how being diversified lessened the blow of the US market crashes of 2002-2004 and 2007-2009.

Like i said in my post, all world portfolios and VT which is a 60/40 split will tend to actualize its true appeal in bear markets and right after a bear market cycle. That's why you see ""VT SIM"" pulling ahead of SPY after 2004 and 2009.  In this graph you can also see how the US large cap bull run has been absolutely unprecedented in US history. It wouldn't be too far off to say most investors are too young and thereby pretty disillusioned to the nature of crashes and bear market cycle. Recency bias runs rampant for US ONLY portfolios.

if anyone more experienced than me can come with a better simulation than me pls feel free to do so but VTSAX and VGTSX are the only ones i could find at the moment.

I will also say, if you can stomach a crash and are young enough (24 years and younger) I agree a VOO portfolio right now would do fine but for most investors, VT is a safer bet that doesnt require rebalancing, mitigates crashes and recovers better in most bear market cycles. VOO only require investors to be more adept in their risk tolerance and more attentive to their investment according to their time horizon. for example being the age of 55 and fully 100% VOO would suck if the market crashes and it takes more than a decade to recover like the US from 2003-2018. youre retirement money would be blown to smithereens with no time to recover before that investor is pretty much 70 years old +.",1760716332.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1o86t58/etfs_to_hold_for_another_30_years/njzoimu/

Tech,ETFs,1o6if1n,Beginner Investor looking for Advice,njhj9fa,"im in a similar boat - i started investing in real estate and now at 35 years old Im in the process of liquidating and shifting it all into equities. Total US market(VTI) or S&P index (VOO) are the wise decisions for your core ETF  - I went with VOO. The main reason is because theyre self cleansing. If in 15 years big Pharma or Energy companies made there way into powerhouse positions then VOO would shift itself around to reflect that. but yea i also am not thinking Tech is going to die off in our future.. perhaps there is a tech bubble but I feel pretty strong that the future is all Techy. Maybe house robots.. maybe full adaptation of self drive cars.. who knows. so I do own quite about bit of VGT. I choose to keep it simple though just 3 ETFs with VOO being the heaviest weighted.

Just consider that if you pick a sector ETF like VGT, its possible the sector does bad. VOO and VTI dont pick sectors, they morph into whatever is the best at all times. With VOO/VTI i think its easier to stomache dips or crashes and keep investing whereas if we have a decently long dip in something like VGT are you going to be second guessing the sector, and will you be able to have the discipline to DCA into it?",1760465012.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1o6if1n/beginner_investor_looking_for_advice/njhj9fa/

Tech,ETFs,1o4uqon,I need some advice,njafuy0,"You are essentially asking for permission to attempt to time the market. While you can get lucky, this usually doesn’t work out that well. The issue is two fold:

.

* it is very hard to buy in at the right time, because the whole market is human psychology stacked on human psychology, you are human, and the right time is literally when you and everyone else is at max fear, you are convinced this time is different and society is going to end, and you’ll need every last dollar to survive the coming storm.

* You honestly don’t know if this crash is coming next week or in 5 years. If it is the latter, the right time to buy in is probably now and just ride it through the storm. It may be cheaper now than it will be at the bottom of the crash.

.

For this reason, the safe and sane way to do this is to dollar cost average your investment into the market over a period of time. If it does crash, you’ll be buying some of your shares cheap. I’d save back enough cash in a high yield savings account to support yourself for 6-18 months, however long you think it will take to find a new job in a down market if you are laid off.

FWIW, GDP is calculated as a bunch of purchasing and other positive stuff minus imports. Imports have been way down lately because of the tariffs. This makes GDP look like it is growing due to that minus sign. However, if we remove imports from the picture, the rest of the economy has actually been contracting for the last 6 months, which technically would mean we are already in recession. There was a nice story in Fortune recently about how NVIDIA has been paying its AI customers to buy its products. Essentially the company is giving away its most expensive products for free (in exchange for equity) but because of the way it was done gets to mark it as a full sale + profit. This practice is very common in major crashes. Risky times!

Speaking though as a veteran of every crash since before the .com bust, it is totally fine to just ride the market down and back up again. You only get into trouble if you panic and sell — usually this ends in buy high, sell low — or delaying too long to buy in because you think it will be doom and gloom forever. There are some still waiting for 2008 to be over so they can buy in cheap.  You should expect at least a half dozen of these things over your investment time frame. Best to get used to it now. If you DCA in and never sell, it is only the last crash that is going to cause trouble for you.

Don’t over think it. Do keep a healthy rainy day fund. 6-18 months expenses, the time it takes to find a new job.",1760370392.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1o4uqon/i_need_some_advice/njafuy0/

In other words, I think it is better to make a budget, live within your means, and invest a smaller amount for the long-term future, than to invest a larger amount but risk ending up without enough cash to cover expenses (requiring you to cash out the investment after only 2 years, potentially at a loss). 

I like the ETFs you are investing in (they are good funds) it just doesn't sound like you can afford to invest $2k/month right now. So for now, invest the smaller amount that you can comfortably afford, and then $2k/month will be a good goal for the future (for example next time you get a raise at work).",1760031741.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1o2bujq/etf_portfolio_advice/nimrtlm/

Tech,ETFs,1nzm6ps,Am I investing in any redundant etfs?,ni39lwc,"- QQQ & QQQM: Owning both QQQ and QQQM provides almost perfect redundancy. You are essentially holding the same basket of 100 stocks twice. It's generally recommended to choose one or the other, typically QQQM for long-term holding due to its slightly lower expense ratio.
- QQQ/QQQM & VOO: There is significant overlap here, especially among the top holdings. Many of the largest tech companies (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, NVIDIA) are top components in both Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500. While the S&P 500 diversifies across more sectors, QQQ/QQQM provides a heavier tilt towards tech and growth.
QQQ/QQQM, VOO & VTI: VTI is the broadest US equity market exposure you have. It contains all the stocks found in VOO and most of the stocks found in QQQ/QQQM. If your goal is broad US market exposure, VTI already covers much of what the other two offer. Owning all three creates an overweighting towards large-cap growth/tech, which may or may not be your intentional strategy.",1759767082.0,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1nzm6ps/am_i_investing_in_any_redundant_etfs/ni39lwc/
Tech,ETFs,1nzm6ps,Am I investing in any redundant etfs?,ni3u919,"All of the holdings/companies inside VOO are also in VTI.

QQQ companies are inside VOO and VTI but the weightings are different. 

QQQ is tech heavy which is ok if you think Tech will do well in the long term.   

When you hold all 3 funds you create what’s called “uncompensated risk” 

Take a look at the article attached to understand that concept a little better.  

https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/  

VOO holds mostly large cap companies the big boys but VTI gives you large, mid and small cap companies so it’s more diversified. Both happen to be great funds imo.

To keep things simple it can be better to just hold VTI and contribute as much as you can to that fund. It gives you the most diversification of US companies meaning you own ALL the companies in the investable US market big and small.

Be careful listening to strangers on the internet and try to do some more research. 

Having some overweighting isn’t the worst thing but it just creates overlap and it isn’t necessary. 

Once you find the ETF or ETF’s that you feel most comfortable with the most important thing is to keep contributing $ to it weekly or monthly if you can.

The U.S. stock market has lagged the international stock market in 5 of the last 7 decades, so it hasn't outperformed traditionally. I will encourage you to read about international diversification [here](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/international-stocks/).

Right. Dividend yield is a factor and Quality is a factor also. For positions like SCHY, it's a dividend ETF but you're picking up the Quality factor in how they screen. So there is some overlap.

Tech,ETFs,1nr2zob,"Advice on Balancing Portfolios (ROTH, traditional brokerage, rollover)",ngpc0a6,"Hi there, I've got a similar setup. Let me preface by saying this isn't financial advice, but I structure it like so:

Rollover Ira - total market, some value funds, and hedges. So for me it works out like VT + VTV + AVUV + VGIT + GDX. The reason I hold value is to balance out top heavy VT a bit with underespresented value stocks, and to act as a diversifer away from heavy tech I own elsewhere.

Roth - aggressive growth, as the Roth is the the only account of these 3 that gives tax-free penalty-free growth here. So I only do QQQM, nothing else here.

Taxable Brokerage - single stocks only, a few Mag 7 stocks, ultra high quality long term compounders, a few speculative stocks related to AI, etc, other best in beed compounders... so this looks like MSFT, GOOGL, META, PLTR, NBIS, BMNR, etc

This setup is ultra solid and has good growth characteristics. The Rollover Ira seeks beta, and the Roth and Taxable seek alpha.

All of this CAN be replaced with just VT + BND + single stocks, but with this setup I capture total market, rotation from growth to value, gold upside during inflation, bonds upside during deflation/recession, and strong returns from market-leading compounders...",1759087979.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1nr2zob/advice_on_balancing_portfolios_roth_traditional/ngpc0a6/

As I previously said, Bitcoin has potential. But, how the way crypto is situated is just not workable towards the average or long-term investor.  Myself and you may understand these aspects, but the older folks along with the new/average investor are more likely to be skeptical about crypto just because it's well known place to get cheated.

No Bonds for me as I still have 30+ years to grow my investments.

assuming an 6-8% yearly ROI compounding annual, im looking at a retirement portfolio of around 2-3million USD. And this is in my ROTH IRA alone. 

You can be a boglehead, have the safety of diversification and durability of a boglehead portfolio to stay the course, and still invest successfully while being what you call  ""fun"". 

My 401K is currently 80% FXAIX 20% FSGGX as thats the only sensible choices i have with my employer outside of bonds.

EDIT: I also have a less than 1% in FBTC thats done very well for me.

overconcentration in a sector CAN make sense to a boglehead and some overlap CAN make sense. More often than not Youtube profiles OVERLAP EXCESSIVELY and it can place investors in a waaaaay more risky investment plan than necessary.

EDIT 2: VIG will drag behind your portfolio. i would consider just adding that percentage onto VOO and when youre ready to retire convert 7% of VOO into a dividend etf. chances are youll have more in dividend income this way than starting to buy dividend etfs and drip investing through it until retirement

EDIT3: 7% VTI doesnt make sense when its already concentrated heavily into VOO. The mid cap and small cap your trying to capture with 7% in VTI is remarkably small theres almost no point in buying only 7% VTI. if you want the exposure it would make more sense to switch your percentages of VOO and VTI. or just drop that 7% of VTI entirely and add that 7% instead to your VOO percentage.",1758564739.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1nnraas/they_hated_my_choices_at_bogleheads_so_now_im_here/nfn2vyh/
Tech,ETFs,1nnraas,"They hated my choices at Bogleheads, so now I'm here",nfncrh5,"VMFXX 25% in an mm fund is very high imo unless this is a mix of your savings/emergency fund/funds for buying dips. That is unless you're just risk averse or are planning a big purchase soon.

VIG feels like too small of a position to be meaningful even though its total yield is technically higher than bonds, but I wouldn't treat this the same way as bonds either because it behaves differently.

Both VTI/VOO and then VUG/VGT overlap and track each other very heavily, there's nothing wrong with it but this just seems like an over-complication for no meaningful reason.

I can see why bogleheads despised this lmao. ETFs and Boglehead mentality go hand-in-hand for the most part, the disagreement is typically in aggressiveness and things like sector bets. Personally, I *mostly* adhere to Boglehead philosophy (without bonds because I'm still a bit too young imo) by doing 40% VT and 30% SPMO as a core (which is basically just a different flavor of the usual all-VT or VTI/VXUS mix, I like it better because VT will auto-rebalance long term while SPMO does a good job of overweighing US + capturing a higher upside). The rest of what I have is stuff like SMH and QTUM - focused bets on things that I expect to outperform for the next 1-5 years but not something I want to hold long term, these are hopefully gains I want to realize early.

In your case I would just trim a lot of this down and be more focused. 25% VMFXX, 55% VOO (though I prefer VTI), 20% VUG for example wold likely give you the same results as what you already have.

Tech,ETFs,1nnraas,"They hated my choices at Bogleheads, so now I'm here",nfooux8,"So, that would depend on a few things. 

What’s the account type that you hold the ETF in? 

If it’s in a Roth IRA or a 401k or a traditional IRA, any account that’s considered tax advantaged you can buy and sell ETFs in the account and there are no tax consequences. 

This is as long as you don’t take the $ out of the account before retirement age 59 1/2. 

You can buy and sell but you can’t withdraw until 59 1/2. Withdrawing from these accounts is what causes a taxable event and has penalties so be careful not to withdraw early from these accounts. 

If you buy and sell VOO or VTI in a taxable brokerage account you would have to pay tax on any gains that you made. Only the gains. 

This would be based on your income and how long you’ve owned the ETF.

If you earn less than $48k and own VOO for more than 12 months and go to sell it you would owe $0 in capital gains tax. 

If you make more than $48k but less than $533k you would owe 15% capital gains tax and over $533k in income you’d owe 20% tax on the gain. 

Remember that’s if you hold the fund longer than a year. If less than a year the gain amount would be added to your ordinary income and you’d be taxed on that amount. 

Here’s an example of you make $50k per year. You buy VOO for $10k and sold it for $15k after 1 year. You would have a gain of $5k and would owe 15% tax because of your income level. You’d owe $750 in capital gains tax for that sale. 

Fees for most ETFs are usually built in to the cost of the ETF. 
Those fees are called the expense ratio and on VOO they are .03%. So for every $1k invested you’d pay 30 cents per year. It’s a very low expense ratio on VOO regardless of what account you buy it in so fees you don’t have to worry about but def check the impact on taxes if you decide to sell. 

Hope that helps.",1758584623.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1nnraas/they_hated_my_choices_at_bogleheads_so_now_im_here/nfooux8/

SCHD is not tax efficient for one, so if this is a taxable account, it's probably best to avoid it. SCHD's focus on dividends ends up giving you exposure to large cap value stocks. This is the reason why one would want to hold SCHD, because factors have expected returns associated with them (if you buy into factor investing).

Not really. Right now there is a lot of overlap between SCHG and SPMO because the momentum is with large cap growth.

I wouldn't engage in factor investing without putting in other factors. So if you're going to add momentum, you need to account for size and quality as well, as examples. Going just straight momentum I don't think is a good idea unless you're good with high risk.

VTI does have some exposure to small and mid cap, but it's somewhat minor. Something like 85% of VTI is the S&P 500. What VTI would give you in this instance is some exposure to quality to balance out the momentum of SPMO.

Tech,ETFs,1ndpqkq,"What’s the point of investing if you can just dump all your brain to S&P, QQQ, etc.?",ndjrsid,"(1) S&P / Nasdaq (QQQ) have done very well for the last several decades, but they have also gone through very major drawdowns compared to a more diversified portfolio with other asset classes / factor exposures.  The strong long-term performance may continue into the future, but inevitably so will the drawdowns.  If you have low risk tolerance or are near/at retirement age, making these your whole portfolio is eventually going to blow up on you.  
(2) The strong performance of the last several decades is not guaranteed to continue forever.  US equity valuations are very high relative to history and relative to other geographies.  Plenty of scenarios could cause S&P/QQQ to see lower returns, even over a fairly long-term time horizon, versus other asset classes, geographies, or factor exposures (I'm not saying this is guaranteed or even likely - people have been trying to make that claim/bet for a lot of the last 10-20 years and regretted it - but it is absolutely *possible*).

I think for a young person (definitely 30s or younger, arguably 40s or younger), making S&P/QQQ a substantial part of your portfolio (up to 70-80%) is not a terrible allocation decision and it's certainly a common one, but you asked the question, so the answer is that it's not without risks.",1757549894.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1ndpqkq/whats_the_point_of_investing_if_you_can_just_dump/ndjrsid/

Tech,ETFs,1ndet5d,Why bother at this point ?,ndgb3bv,"I was trying to go through a thought exercise today what a world of the future is where Nvidia is the most valued company.  I don’t have anything nvidia inside my house other than about half of the GPUs inside gaming hardware (\~20% cost?).  I guess cars may likely have nvidia hardware as autonomy gets more critical… \~3-4% total cost?  Minus Tesla, car companies are far below the tech giants.

Manufacturing and data centers seem like the primary growth source.  (I’m bundling in ChatGPT and agentics to data centers, call that a foul if you want) If I’m a manufacturer I’d want to offload expensive hardware from my assembly line.  These will require a lot of compute in digital design and AI modeling but long term I’d say the preference is requests still go to the data center(s) rather than local as well.

So maybe we see 10x data centers that need hardware refreshed every 5 years?   But does direct consumer demand trail off in the 10 years as local AI models are “good enough” and rarely, if ever call for compute help?  So growth may be sinusoidal with this.  Possibly demand reaches a point every “real” city has a data center district to minimize latency.

Then there is AGI (I think i have to say AGI superintellect now).  But isn’t it called the singularity in part because we can’t see the other side?  If we knew what AGI would do we’d just have smart people do that right?

Tech,ETFs,1ndet5d,Why bother at this point ?,neykdub,"OK...first...you seem like a thoughtful, intelligent person which is why I am answering. Are market dynamics different now compared to 20 years ago? Yes. Absolutely. But, in my opinion, not for the reasons you listed, necessarily. I think you vastly overrate retail investing (passive or otherwise) and their impact on the overall market. I would argue that high frequency / program trading is much more impactful. Retail volume is less than 25% of the daily trading volume, so if hedge funds decide ""it is time to sell"" there is nothing retail investors can do except enjoy the ride down. There are, of course, anomalies like Gamestop, where a concerted effort by liked-mind individuals can attack a specific stock with punishing results to an unlucky hedge fund that was overextended. By and large, though, retail is a pencil necked geek in the ring with Mike Tyson (Institutions). I guess the latest example was April, where the tariffs impacted markets in a substantial way. I was on Reddit a lot, and I didn't read about a ton of people selling. I read a ton of posts from people who were shitting their pants...or from those that were buying (good on them!). So, I am not saying that money flows into IRAs, 401ks, etc. aren't impactful nor substantial...they are. What I am saying is that the institutions that run ""big money"" kick dirt in the fact of those inflows when they sell. At the end of the day....it is still as simple as supply vs. demand. 

As for tech...I would argue that it is MORE speculative now than ever before. When I was building my nest egg, the PC was the big deal. MSFT, CSCO and INTC were the 600 lb. gorillas and they actually made money. Now, you have so many companies trading for absurd valuations (some with no revenue much less EPS) that are up 400% this YEAR. I know many will say ""this time is different"", but it is never different. The more insane it gets just means the reversion will be worse. Note, I am not talking about stocks like NVDA. That is an absolute beast. I am talking about quantum computing stocks, mini reactor stocks, etc. While promising, they are in la la land. This is all late stage bull market trading IMO. 

Of course, I could be completely wrong and definitely have been! But, look at the market dynamics. Do you think it is healthy? Are you comfortable with 7 companies (or thereabouts) being responsible for the lion's share of the market gains? You don't think that indexes are a VERY crowded trade? An even more important question is....do you think valuation matters? Does it matter, long term, whether the market  PE is roughly 50% higher than normal? Does it matter that Warren Buffet (I know, I know...someone will tell me that ""he is old"") has his biggest cash position ever? Is he stupid? I think I know the answer, but others will probably disagree. Certainly, anyone that has been a net seller has been wrong thus far, but how about 6 months from now? 

I am investing pretty conservatively here. I have a lump sum I want to invest, but I wouldn't dream of throwing it into VOO or QQQ. No way in hell. Not a lump sum. The funny thing is that people think those 2 funds are ""diversifying"". They are more similar than dissimilar with regards to weighting. The top 5 holdings (cap weighted, mind you) are virtually identical. So, people are double exposed. As long as the ""good times keep rolling"" it will resemble the party of a lifetime- hookers and cocaine for all:) But, when the music stops....it is going to hurt bad IMO.

“Hey OP, some thoughts on QQQ.

Given that tech and AI will likely still be king in the future, is the higher risk (and volatility)/higher return from QQQM worth it, or should I settle for an average market return from VOO only? A quick compare between S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 historically shows that the latter has done incredibly well vs the former.

What makes you think that both of the following are true:

1.	⁠Financials and REITs will underperform everything else
2.	⁠The US exchange a stock trades is a factor of performance

Holding QQQ states that both are true. Because QQQ intentionally excludes financials and REITs, and it won't accept stocks that trade on the NYSE.

Furthermore, predicting what sectors will outperform and underperform is incredibly difficult.

Example 1:

From its approximate start in 1971, the software industry has grown more than any other, from basically non-existent to the largest industry by market capitalization at the end of 2019 at nearly 15% of the US stock market. In contrast, the oil industry has seen a massive decline in market capitalization, from nearly 15% of the US market in 1971 to about 3% at the end of 2019. Over this period, a dollar invested in the oil index grew to $134, while a dollar invested in the software index grew to $76.

Example 2:

From 1900 to 2020, rail companies' share of the US stock market declined from 65% to less than 1%. This would seem to be the perfect example of a dying market. However, over that time period, rail stocks have outperformed the total US market, airline stocks, bank stocks, energy stocks, utilities, and car manufacturers.

Some great empirical data here:

https://www.jstor.org/stable/25592515#:~:text=As%20the%20adoption%20probability%20increases,the%20new%20economy%27s%20market%20beta.


Additionally:

The market is already over 1/4 tech at this point. Why concentrate further? Tech by definition is the future and ""innovation,"" but that doesn't have much to do with stock market returns, which are not correlated with GDP growth. See: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-6622.2012.00385.x

Where Stock market returns (both internationally and domestically) have found to have had a negative correlation with GDP growth.

Concentration

QQQ only holds 100 securities.

We know empirically that the distribution of stock returns is incredibly skewed.

Only a handful of stocks (4%) are responsible for ALL positive market returns, with most (96%) only matching T-Bill rate (Bessimbinder, 2018). The significant skewness in long-run stock returns helps to explain why poorly diversified active strategies consistently underperform market averages. Bessimbinder examines US data from 1926 - 2016, with a sample size of 26,000 stocks. Source: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2900447

TLDR,

Because of this significant skewness, you are better off holding the total market (all the losers and winners) than trying to pick stocks to avoid the “losers” and risk missing out on the few winners that drive the market.

QQQ potentially misses out many of those winners, which can be extremely costly long term.

Understanding Stock Returns:

I understand the reasoning behind QQQ. Tech has done tremendously well in recent decades, and it is reasonable to think this will persist.

But it is also reasonable to think that it will NOT persist. : https://www.pwlcapital.com/are-the-largest-large-cap-growth-stocks-where-its-at/

We know from financial economics that a stock's value is the discounted price that the market is willing to pay for the company's expected future profits. The expected stock return is the discount rate applied to those expected future profits. If you expect QQQ to deliver some level of profits and you buy those expected profits at a 10% discount, you expect to earn a 10% return on your investment.

In order for big tech to continue delivering unexpectedly good stock returns, they will need to deliver financial results that exceed the current high expectations that the market has set for them.

Given the current valuations of some of these major tech firms, it is rational to posit that these high valuations are not justified by potential growth.

As an example, can Apple grow at 7.7x revenue over the next decade? Probably not. (It grew at 2.2x the last decade in one of the most favourable, low interest rate environments EVER.

International Diversification

I know this is can be an extremely contentious topic on this sub-reddit. But there is no evidence to support that a purely domestic portfolio (and in your case, specifically a large cap domestic portfolio) is a better long term solution.

Please see a few of the empirical papers on this here:

https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/The-Long-Run-Is-Lying-to-You

https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3689958

https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/17-085_8b6f5e18-a47e-4725-b14a-e5c4afa2add3.pdf

The TLDR is that you should probably get international diversification.

Conclusion:

SPY + QQQ is only focused on large cap domestic.

It is tech heavy, growth heavy and misses out on thousands of small and mid cap domestic stocks, as well as thousands of global stocks.

The best portfolio is one that can help you sleep at night. You need to figure out an allocation that YOU CAN STICK TO.

Because a reasonable portfolio that you can stick to for 30 years is MUCH BETTER than a ""perfect"" portfolio that you can only stick to for 5 years.


Within the context of a reliable and successful financial plan, the number one priority should be to maximize your endurance and durability as an investor. How can you increase the odds that you stick around long enough for the power of compounding to work?

Including small and mid cap domestic stocks, and international stocks INCREASES the chances that you can stick around for the long term by reducing tracking error.

If you invested only in SPY + QQQ and emerging markets went on an absolute tear for 6 tears while US large cap underperformed,  would you stick to your current portfolio?

Switching out SPY and QQQ for a total market domestic fund would be something to consider. Additionally I would also consider adding an broad international fund as well.

Believe me, it's not as SEXY as a tech heavy fund that has lots of AI and semi-conductor exposure.

But I'm not investing to be sexy. The opposite actually.

And it still has exposure to all those stocks, with more diversification.

“Hey OP, some thoughts on QQQ.

Given that tech and AI will likely still be king in the future, is the higher risk (and volatility)/higher return from QQQM worth it, or should I settle for an average market return from VOO only? A quick compare between S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 historically shows that the latter has done incredibly well vs the former.

What makes you think that both of the following are true:

1.	⁠Financials and REITs will underperform everything else
2.	⁠The US exchange a stock trades is a factor of performance

Holding QQQ states that both are true. Because QQQ intentionally excludes financials and REITs, and it won't accept stocks that trade on the NYSE.

Furthermore, predicting what sectors will outperform and underperform is incredibly difficult.

Example 1:

From its approximate start in 1971, the software industry has grown more than any other, from basically non-existent to the largest industry by market capitalization at the end of 2019 at nearly 15% of the US stock market. In contrast, the oil industry has seen a massive decline in market capitalization, from nearly 15% of the US market in 1971 to about 3% at the end of 2019. Over this period, a dollar invested in the oil index grew to $134, while a dollar invested in the software index grew to $76.

Example 2:

From 1900 to 2020, rail companies' share of the US stock market declined from 65% to less than 1%. This would seem to be the perfect example of a dying market. However, over that time period, rail stocks have outperformed the total US market, airline stocks, bank stocks, energy stocks, utilities, and car manufacturers.

Some great empirical data here:

Tech,ETFs,1n7di6q,Advice,ncju2wq,"I’m not a boglehead and I think that philisophy is too cookie cutter to be a good approach to investing for everyone but foreign stocks are absolutely not “junk” plenty of foreign stocks and funds outperform US stocks and funds. In addition markets are cyclical so while the US is on a 20 year bullrun eventually there will be a reversion to the mean and foreign stocks will outperform. If you look back at the last 50 years US stocks have only led 50% of the time. Also US indices are at enormous valuations rn in sharp contrast to  international (especially value) stocks which are undergoing a decade long rut as people pile into growth stocks and crypto. Smart money (wall st) already has recognized this and money has began to rotate into international equities especially sectors traditionally dominated by value stocks such as healthcare, industrials and energy. Year to date international equities from both the developed and emerging markets have beat US stocks and US information technology sector stocks are the LEAST liked by wall st they have been in years as evidenced by the amount of firms that are shorting them. US stocks have momentum behind them but completely ignoring the rest of the world because of some generalization like “foreign stocks are bad” is robbing yourself of one of the tools (global diversification) you have to protect and grow your portfolio. 

Also truthfully there is some junk out there in the foregin markets which is why you wouldnt want to go with a fund as broad as VXUS rather going with a tactical factor fund like IDMO, AVDV or FNDE or a more targeted sector / region funds like INDA, FGM, or EUAD is the way to get foreign exposure without reducing your long term growth.",1757077746.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1n7di6q/advice/ncju2wq/

1. Use SPLG as a core holding, with SCHG acting as a way to tilt toward growth.
2.

Great companies actually don't continue to perform spectacularly on and on. They have strong runs and then end up disappointing due to ever growing expectations. Plenty of super profitable companies have underperformed for certain periods in the past, it's not a guarantee of anything.


If you truly have higher risk tolerance and want higher chance of better returns over the next decade+, you would invest more into small cap value across US and International. AVUV+AVDV or DFSV+DISV at least combined of 30 percent or more of a portfolio will have more of an impact than any of this overlapped mishmash retail Reddit performance chasing. If you look at those funds and can't handle the underperformance risk then realize that is how the premium is captured long term and you can't reap benefits if you aren't willing to endure pain. Just realize ALL portfolios will suffer some tough periods.

Tech,ETFs,1mx7kjl,why does SPMO get bashed for having 50%-60% weight in top 10 companies' vs other ETFs?,na94clu,"The portfolio visualizer I linked was comparing growth to value, as most performance of SPY, SPMO, and QQQ is growth at the moment. 

Comparing the Russell 2000 to SPY is pointless when it comes to running that backtest because Russell 2000 is both growth and value. It is well established that small cap growth stocks lag their small cap value peers. This is why small cap value has the potential to benefit from the size effect. My point is that value has its place and long term growth may not outperform like it has in recent history. Being invested in almost anything at all, as opposed to nothing, is obviously still good, so if going all in on growth is what keeps someone invested in the market, sure, go for it, but if it drops 50%, and lags behind value for 5 years, they are much more likely to lose their resolve and make a mistake (like selling low, or leaving markets entirely, etc.). Meaning, the end result is nearly the same between the two. History favors value, recent history favors growth, but only in larger companies. Given similar results, it makes little sense to expose the portfolio to human drawdown psychology, and might not be worth the test. I’m saying a young investor should be adding bonds or anything to offset risk, but my point is diversifying some, will not harm the end result they are looking for, unless the result they’re looking for, is based on a sector bet, that exposes them to unnecessary (& uncompensated) risk.",1755959609.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1mx7kjl/why_does_spmo_get_bashed_for_having_5060_weight/na94clu/

why do you think the semi conductor segment is going to outperform the market? I don’t know the next 10 years, it definitely might, it might now. If you beleive in the segment then I’d keep it but limit it to 5-10%.

Did a little bit of thinking and came up with a 40/30 split of VTI and SPMO for my baseline. Also, given my timeframe, how much should I allocate to UTES? Maybe bring it down to 5%? Should I throw in a dividend ETFs as well or just reinforce what I would have?

Tech,ETFs,1mt53a0,ETF Portfolio based on Factors,n9c176n,"**Neither Vanguard nor Blackrock are renowned for factor-based ETFs. The ones you need to look into are Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA) & Avantis ETFs. Therefore, the risk premia associated with factor investing will likely have no benefit towards this portfolio given the current ETFs selected.**

You have basically created a very complex version of US total stock market which can be achieved by investing into VTI for simplicity. Remember, you have to manage and re-balance this portfolio to their respective allocations atleast annually to ensure the portfolio is correctly configured. Now, imagine doing this exercise for 30+ years leading into retirement. Do you see yourself doing this rebalancing over & over again? If not, then condense your ETFs to 2-3 at max.

Sector bets like VGT or IYW are not great because the whole wide world already knows about TECH & AI and hence those companies are already overweighted into any S&P500 and US Total Stock Market ETFs anyway. So, all you’re doing is further concentrating your portfolio into MAG7 holdings. Not ever a best practise to concentrate into a handful of holdings.

**Your conclusion that your mix of ETFs has been able to beat S&P 500 is flawed given the short time frame. You need to do regression analysis and monte carlo simulations to understand the backtests of how this portfolio mix would perform during extreme stress & volatility events like GFC and COVID.**

Tech,ETFs,1mo7rph,Opinion on my roth ira account,n8acq43,"(1) Too busy (2) redundant in several places (3) an improper tilt towards dividends as a 30 year old. 

You can simplify to 1-3 funds:

* If you simply want the global stock market: VT.
* If you want to tilt the global market towards US or ex-US: VTI + VXUS = VT.
* If you want to tilt your US towards large, mid, or small cap: [VOO + VXF = VTI](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Approximating_total_stock_market).
* If you want to tilt your ex-US towards developed vs emerging markets: [VEA + VWO = VXUS](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Approximating_total_international_stock_market).

Some more thoughts:

* VGT is a sector fund, make sure you appreciate what [concentration risk](https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/concentration-risk) is, and don't tilt too heavy towards one sector.
* VGT, VOO, QQQ, DIA, VYM, SPYD, SCHD, SCHH are all redundant when you have VTI.
* You have multiple dividend funds, which are inappropriate for a 30 year old generally speaking since they underperform the broad market. There's a misconception going around that ""more dividends = more return"" which is untrue. Dividend funds can be appropriate as a retiree who needs monthly income, but in your accumulation phase it's weighing you down
* Replacing VOO with SPLG is fine. Just making sure you understand the scope of the cost save: VOO has a 0.03% ER to SPLG's 0.02% ER. If you had $100k it's the difference between $30 and $20 in annual fund cost.

Then, all of these would essentially be US only (companies having a global revenue source does not provide international exposure, as it is capturing the performance of foreign markets that we want and companies act far more like their home market), and single country risk is an uncompensated risk. Different countries over and under perform the global weighted average at different times, there's plenty where the US was below that average. An uncompensated risk is one that doesn't bring higher expected long term returns. Uncompensated risk should be avoided whenever possible. Compensated vs uncompensated risk:

>Uncompensated risk is very different; it is the risk specific to an individual company, sector, **or country.**


As for what I consider the ""best mix,"" consider this: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio The bonds are the part that adjust risk level. More bonds equals less risk. Alternatively, a target date (index) fund is effectively the 3 fund concept in a single wrapper, managed for you. They are designed to be ""one and done,"" the only thing you hold. They're fully diversified internally for you. These can be found with expense ratios as low as 0.08%-0.12% for the Fidelity, iShares, Schwab, and Vanguard index based ones. The target date and target allocation funds typically are not recommended for taxable accounts but are fine for tax advantaged. VT (2 letters)/VTWAX would cover both stock roles in one fund.

If you want more aggressive than that, look back towards the factor links.",1754751838.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1mlqxpk/what_is_best_etf_mix/n7sb82i/

Tech,ETFs,1mk2703,What to add to my holdings?,n7fipun,"You're doing fine. 

You're overlooking the fact that all the ETFs you're listing basically hold the same top 10 stocks. 

You should study what's under the hood. 

Each ETF website has a ""holdings"" or ""composition"" section that shows you the weight of every constituent in that fund that's trying to match an underlying index. 

If you want even more risk, it's not about adding more ETFs to your portfolio that hold the same stocks. It's more about adding leverage. 

Look into how leverage can obliterate your portfolio. It's not for the faint of heart at high levels. 

At 21, the key for you is to invest in yourself to increase your earning potential, increase your current income, and keep auto-investing. 

All these ETFs discussed in this subreddit all basically track the same top 10 stocks since there's never any new, novel discussion about interesting ETFs. And that's completely fine. 

Best advice I ever got was get my $100K-200K in some broad, blended (growth + value) stock index fund (insert any global, S&P 500, total US stock index fund) before trying to tilt away from market cap weight. For example, I invested my first $200K in FXAIX (Fidelity's S&P 500 fund) held in my 401k before doing anything exotic. 

This ensures you're earning average market returns which is a tremendously positive thing because without insider information, average market returns have generated anywhere from 7-10% annualized average returns. 

Use a investment calculator, adding your own monthly contributions and plug in 7%, 8%, 9%, 10% as the returns and you'll be blown away how amazing compounding returns can be over time.

Yes, they will be functionally the same. And as an EU citizen, I don't think you are legally allowed to buy non UCITS compliant funds.

My own opinion on your allocation is that there is too much US exposure; you have seen for yourself how much overlap there is. If you are just after more US tech exposure, then 80-90 VWCE/10-20 SXRV or SXR8 is probably sufficient.",1754658312.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1mjrine/etf_portfolio_opinions/n7leu90/

Tech,ETFs,1mjrine,ETF portfolio opinions,n7m4j49,">Do you think its the best aporoach?

For what it's worth, I think the best approach, especially for a beginner, is 100% VWCE. It is already heavy on US stocks as the US is currently the largest equity market by market cap, but it's also invested in other markets around the world, so if any market outperforms relative to others, their share in the fund will increase, and you'll benefit from it without having to do anything. Investing in an all world fund is essentially saying that you don't know which market will perform best in the future, so you just buy the global market. In doing so, you get whatever global equities return over time, and you avoid the risk of underperforming in case the country or sector you choose to overweight doesn't perform as expected. You should do your own research and develop your own convictions though, as this is your personal portfolio.   
  
80/20 VWCE/SXR8 is fine if you want more US exposure than is present in VWCE, and are prepared to bet that the US market will continue performing as well as it has the past decade or so.  I recommended an 80-90/10-20 allocation because you said in your original post that you wanted to overweight the US, and a 10-20% additional allocation to sp500 wouldn't be a huge deviation from 100% VWCE.  

I wouldn't recommend picking single stocks, unless you're prepared to do research on individual companies and develop your own convictions regarding their prospects as investments.",1754666089.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1mjrine/etf_portfolio_opinions/n7m4j49/
Tech,ETFs,1mjekpc,Moving a previous employer’s traditional 401k to an  IRA and Roth IRA so I can invest in ETFs,n7akjxu,"You *can* do this, but keep in mind: if your household income is above \~$230k (for married couples filing jointly in 2025), you're likely ineligible to contribute directly to a Roth IRA. In that case, you might consider a Backdoor Roth IRA, which involves contributing to a Traditional IRA and then converting it to a Roth.

**However**, this strategy only works cleanly if you don’t have any pre-tax money in other Traditional IRAs, SEP IRAs, or SIMPLE IRAs, because the pro-rata rule kicks in. That rule forces you to pay taxes on a proportional amount of all your pre-tax IRA funds, not just the new contribution. So, if you already have a balance in a Traditional IRA, it can make the backdoor Roth inefficient or costly.

You'd be better off rolling over that IRA into your employer plan, in this case. If you're below that 230k, nevermind. You can contribute to Roth directly.

Tech,ETFs,1mheji4,Beginner Question on how to spread funds between ETFS.,n6vkmt4,"There are 2 basic activities in the accumulation phase, before retirement:

1. contributions
2. rebalancing

As you approach retirement and retire, this transitions to

1. distributions
2. rebalancing

For this reason, Jack Bogle recommended gradually shifting from wealth growth to wealth protection as you move forward in time. For most, I recommend Age - 20 in percentage to bonds and cash. BND can be a good alternative.

Some condescend against bonds, but I am not sure that they appreciate risk adjusted returns, that is, not just measuring returns but also the risk taken to achieve those returns--obviously, you want the most returns for the least risk, and risk is measured in the annualized variance of returns. A simple way to say this is that an asset that returns 1% per month on average is greatly superior to one that returns 12% per year over decades. An asset that returns 50% Year 1, and -50% Year 2 nets -25%, and no one wants that. The best defense against risk is diversification.

As you are early in the investment journey, investing as much as you can in your 20s and 30s is the key, as the power of compounding returns will help you double your investment 2-4-8-16-32x. In your 40s and 50s, you can still double, but fewer times 2-4-8x. $3.2 million is a lot better retirement than $800,000. Many experts recommend investing 10-15% of your income. Those who allocate more than 20% can often retire in their 40s or 50s.

In addition to contributing, rebalancing annually back to your target allocation is essential. When stocks have a great year, you sell some to buy less sexy bonds. And when stocks are in the toilet, you sell some of those now safe and less risky bonds to buy stocks when your friends and neighbors are panic selling. Rebalancing is a disciplined and regular way to buy assets lower, and sell them higher, and will help you double your portfolio one more time than if you didn't--the difference between $3.2 million and $1.6 million over decades.

I'm close to retirement, but if I were 21 (again), I might allocate accordingly:

* 1% BND (increase this 1% per year)
* 5% cash (to buy stocks or bonds if/when they crash)
* 70% VTI
* 24% VXUS

A last point about the bond allocation: Bogle recommended treating income such as Social Security as a bond allocation. So if you are collecting $20,000 per year in benefits, assuming a 4% safe withdrawal rate for distributions, that implies an additional $500,000 allocation to bonds.

An uncompensated risk is one that doesn't bring higher expected long term returns. Uncompensated risk should be avoided whenever possible. Compensated vs uncompensated risk:

For both the underlying securities will change over time. You can look up how the S&P 500 and Nasdaq choose their underlying assets and adjust them over time to better understand that. 

Some stuff worth noting:

Nasdaq: 

- heavy sector bias which adds risk but also more reward potential. There is no guarantee it only goes up just because we have seen that so far. And if the big drop happens as you’re about to retire all those gains can quickly be eliminated (just make sure as you get older you slowly get more conservative to avoid this)

- only 100 vs 500 stocks. 

- lacks financials so if they overperform you miss out

- if value beats growth, you miss out

S&P 500:

- while its tech sector influence has expanded, it has a history of shifting over time so if tech drops in popularity it will shift to adjust so though it looks like a risk now, long term, it is much lower as the index sector balance will adjust

- covers all sectors in the US so if anything booms you don’t miss out 

- balances growth and value (right now with a growth tilt) so if either outperforms you don’t miss out

- but sadly due to higher diversification it can reduce returns if bull markets run most of your investment life

- generally considered a better return for your risk taking than Nasdaq historically even though yes Nasdaq outperforms thanks to tech. You did so with much less risk

My rule of thumb is any spending in the next 10 years should be in fixed income. That's equivalent to a TDF glide path and a 4% withdrawal rate starting at 10% 10 years out from retirement and going up to 60/40 at retirement. If you have. Lower withdrawal rate like 3% it'd be 70/30 at retirement. 

If you're including other savings goals it would be cased on that, so a 35yo with 100k in retirement savings at 90/10 and 50k for a house down payment looking to buy in the next couple years would be 60/40 overall.",1761413253.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1oflf04/at_what_age_do_you_guys_startstarted_investing_in/nlcazje/

It isn't a lot, and especially at first it'll be a trivial amount (unless you're starting off with way more money than I'm assuming).  In a million dollar portfolio, it'll be several hundred dollars a year, depending on specifics.  [Here's one thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1kww9fm/how_much_does_one_save_via_the_foreign_tax_credit/) where this is discussed. So, eventually you will save some money in a taxable account, if a significant amount of your portfolio is in a taxable account (you can't claim it in a Roth or traditional IRA). So yes, it can save some money, but a lot of people don't bother.
2. I wouldn't recommend any other ETFs, really (see my silly link above at the end).  A classic three fund portfolio covers US, non-US international, and bonds. If you decide not to have bonds yet, VT covers the other two categories of assets. Done! There's a reason you see a lot of people here say ""VT and chill.""
3. ""good annual returns plus being relatively safe.""  I mean, sure.  Don't we all!  If this money is for the long term, you're ""safe"" with VT or VTI+VXUS or similar highly diversified stock portfolio. You won't truly lose your money in the long term unless something cataclysmic happens (think Fallout).  But it could be a rocky ride in the meantime.

Hey Bogleheads,

I’m 30 and just starting my long-term investing journey. My goal is a simple, mostly hands-off portfolio.

- Taxable (Fidelity): 100% VTI — where any extra money goes after maxing tax-advantaged accounts.

- Roth IRAs (mine + spouse) Planning on max both mine and my wife’s: 80% VUG / 20% VGT, possibly adding 3–5% BTC. Aware it’s tech-heavy but comfortable with the volatility for long-term growth.

- SEP IRA: Planning $20–60k per year. Debating between keeping it simple with VT or doing 70/30 VTI + VXUS for more control.

- Emergency fund: 6 months in SPAXX at Fidelity; plan to redirect overflow to BND. Will probably add more here as when I get older. 

Looking for feedback on whether VT makes sense for the SEP IRA or if splitting VTI/VXUS is better. Also open to any tax-efficiency tips.

This is fine too. Personally I wouldn't overflow anything to BND, instead I would max tax advantaged accounts and invest the rest in stock index funds in a brokerage account.

>Looking for feedback on whether VT makes sense for the SEP IRA or if splitting VTI/VXUS is better. 

I would personally recommend VT, it encourages less tinkering.

No need to tilt towards tech, or [any sector](https://novelinvestor.com/sector-performance/), because sectors outperform in unpredictable ways and the market already has priced in all the available information about future expected performance. Tilting in that way tends to just introduce [uncompensated risk](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/), which means that you're taking on more risk than investing in a total market index fund, but you can't expect to receive better returns than the market average.

You don't need any concentration in ""the 100 largest (non-financial) companies that happen to trade on the nasdaq exchange"". It's a nonsense index. There's no fundamental reason for that selection criteria to outperform in the future, it only looks attractive because of the last decade of performance. It's only accidentally a tech-leaning fund, but *you don't need extra tech*.

There’s some overlap with VOO and VGT. Depending on who you ask some people will say VOO or VTI (or their equivalents). 

VGT has a 0.1% ER vs VOO with 0.03%. Not portfolio breaking at this point but getting the the Millions in your account this can be up to $700 per million. Not the end of the world. 

VTI will give you a much broader coverage over VOO as it also covers the mid and small stocks that VOO does not. (More broad, therefore theoretically more diversified) 

Some will aim for a much easier VT which is a typical 60/40 US/ex-US fund. But as you get other accounts (taxable, 401k, 457, etc) it may make more sense to split them yourself to VTI and VXUS to allocate them across multiple accounts for better tax purposes. 

The level of US vs Ex-US depends on your risk tolerance. Conventional boglehead teachers appear to have a safe 60/40 split for this. 

Some people increase the US/ex-us ration to up to 80/20. VTI and VXUS allows you to do that whereas VT wouldn’t. 

As you get older (mid to late 30s) you’d start adding bonds to your account. 

I stick with a standard VTI (or equivalent total stock, or S&P500 fund if my 401k doesn’t have a good total stock market fund), VXUS (or equivalent) and BND for my bonds. 

I prefer simplicity in my life and don’t like to worry about the daily ups and downs as the swings are HUGE now. Stocks 90% Bonds 10%. Us/ex-US stocks 80/20.

(Note: ""Compelling reasons"" do not include ""tech is the hot sector right now"" or ""I'm all in on growth stocks"" or ""Dividends are so important to long-term wealth accumulation."")

Relative to a global market cap weighted portfolio, you are extremely light on exposure to small cap U.S. stocks (maybe zero exposure), and you are underweight on exposure to international stocks, which by latest estimates are closer to 35% rather than 20%. Correspondingly, you are significantly overweight on exposure to a handful of mega cap U.S. stocks. You may think you're diversified, when in fact, you're not as much as you think you are. NVDA alone is 17% of VGT and also 8% of VOO. MSFT is 14% and 7%, respectively. Whereas, if you bought a simple, global market cap weighted fund like VT, NVDA and MSFT would each only be about 4%.

They may outperform VOO in the short run, but are just as likely to lag if the Ai bubble pops.  If you believe that you will outsmart the market with this strategy, that is fine, it will only be a relatively small drag overall.   

The BND is ok but I would consider putting it in the Roth, especially as you get into the higher tax brackets.  The interest you get is counted as ordinary income and taxed at a higher rate if you are in a high tax bracket.   

The bigger picture is that these are just nitpicks and likely wont change the overall trajectory of your investment portfolio, but they don't quite accord with best practices.

This is a variant of the ""TikTok"" portfolio.  It is popularized by finfluencers who are naïve, disingenuous, or both.  There is no reason why ""what exchange a stock is traded on while excluding financials"" would be a reason for it to outperform, which is what QQQ is.  It's only tech heavy by historical accident.  And there is no reason to expect Tech or any sector to outperform.  It's also a bet that Pepsi and CostCo will outperform Coke and Walmart.  There is no reason to seek out dividends for their own sake, which is the main reason why many people choose SCHD \[\*\].  There is no reason to seek out real estate on its own, as it's fully included in total market indexes.  There is no reason why the top 500 companies by market cap would outperform:  it's an arbitrary line, so VOO is okay, but VTI is more diversified and they are highly correlated.

\[\*\] there are some reasons why SCHD might be included in some portfolios, but it's not due to the dividends it's due to factor loading, but that's pretty advanced and should require some understanding and education for why one might want to overweight or underweight factors.

There are behavioral and succession aspects to also consider, such as:

1. What if you something happens to you? Can your partner and/or kids, assuming they exist, properly handle your portfolio? Do they even want to have that responsibility?


2. Do you need someone to bounce ideas off throughout the year, especially when markets are not going up all the time, they have over the last few years? This entails someone having someone that will also keep you disciplined and aligned with your plan (this assumes you have financial plan). Someone who can also talk you out of bad but often tempting ideas, which tend to creep you when markets are down or more generally when greed kicks in for any number of reasons. 


3. What about time spent on portfolio checking, record keeping and the like? Yes, Boglehead portfolios are simple. We all like them. It’s a feature not a bug.

There's no fundamental reason for that selection criteria to outperform in the future, it only looks attractive because of the last decade of performance.

Is the post-tax a [mega backdoor Roth](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Mega-backdoor_Roth) setup?

> 200k Traditional IRA currently split 30% VT, 10% VXUS, 20% SGOV, 10% IBTI & 10% NVDIA

VT contains Total US + Total International. The first two components of the [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio). VXUS is total International again. SGOV is a cash equivalent and probably doesn't belong in your retirement account. IBTI looks like a three-year Treasury bond?

NVDA is already contained in VT. Tilting towards individual companies tends to just introduce [uncompensated risk](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/), which means that you're taking on more risk than investing in a total market index fund, but you can't expect to receive better returns than the market average.

> 131k Brokerage with 80% SGOV 20%, 10% VT & 10% VXUS. I plan to DCA 100k into VT in October.

Again, VT + VXUS overlaps. VTI + VXUS is a more usual combination, or VT alone.

> I know I am too cash heavy, but I am a single mom with sole custody who won’t be an empty nester for another 3 years and who will have to pay for my daughter’s college

I think you should just consider your cash as separate from your long term investing portfolio. If you need a large pile of cash to insure against emergencies, to fund near-term expenses, that's fine, but I'd consider it separate.

Max annual into Roth IRA - currently 7000  
After-tax/brokerage using tax-managed mutual funds

I prefer having multiple account types: 401k/Trad IRA, Roth IRA and  after-tax/brokerage to give more choice later when minimizing taxable income when money is withdrawn. No one knows the future of tax code but to me Roth IRA is best place followed by 401k/Trad IRA.

One concern: for Roth IRA the Adjusted Annual Gross Income/AGI limit for single starts at 150,000 to reduce contributions (and at 165,000 is zero contribution) which means in future it may not be available to you as your AGI increases and/or if you get an income bump. So perhaps max annual into Roth IRA today.

De-risk when you're approaching the time at which you'll actually need the funds. Since you won't be able to access the Roth without penalty until 59.5, you should start introducing fixed income and dividend paying equity closer to then. The exact answer is very personal, but I generally wouldn't start to derisk this young unless you have an extremely low tolerance for volatility, and it's difficult to stomach market swings. 

I'd also like to just say that IMO, it's best practice to leave Roth money alone as much as possible through retirement. It's best to have a healthy mix of taxable, tax-deferred, and non-taxable money in retirement. If you have a good mix of all three, it allows you much more control over your tax situation in retirement. 

Since Roth money is the most valuable as it's typically tax free, you'd want to leave it as the last pot to touch, or when you're in a year where recognizing more income is particularly unappealing.

You should do some of your own research and learn about BH philosophy. It’ll help you understand the feedback you’re receiving from commenters.   The links below have everything you need to educate yourself.   

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/s/91Mpq5TK3G  

There’s some overlap in your funds. You can make some adjustments that reduce your overall holdings and will simplify your portfolio and keep you broadly diversified.   VTI has all the holdings of VOO and QQQ. Think of it like owning all the investable companies in the entire U.S. (when you add VNQ, VOO and QQQ it’s not really giving you anything extra just overweighting some companies and sectors that you already own.)   

With VXUS that’s investing internationally in all the companies outside the U.S.   So, by holding VTI and VXUS you pretty much own all the companies in the entire investable world. Doesn’t get more broadly diversified than that and that’s all you need to set yourself up for long term growth. Just keep contributing and chill!  

I’m assuming you’re young so you probably don’t need bonds now. There are different opinions regarding bonds and as you get older you want to add them but if you’re young you don’t have to. In the links you can read more about this.          

So maybe you can just go 80% VTI and 20% VXUS . That’s it. You’re  good. Set it and forget it! Keep it simple for long term growth! 

None of your choices are dumb. However, diversifying is going to give you the best chance of solid returns for the long term rather than hoping certain companies or sectors always  perform well. 

Great job on asking for feedback and I assure you when you educate yourself on BH investing it’ll all make sense.

Tech,Bogleheads,1nhu5ox,Diversification via ETFs,nefmy9w,"> Is the Dave Ramsey idea that “bonds will only go down in price because the interest rates can only go up from here” coming into play?

Was that something he said several years ago?  It doesn't really fit with today's rate environment.  Not that it was a very good reason back then either.  

> Does that even apply to index funds, or does it only affect direct bonds? I’m unsure of the mechanics of this.

A lot of people on this sub misunderstand bonds and/or misuse them.  If you're investing to fund vague retirement-related expenses there is an optimal duration for your bond holdings and it is optimal to regularly rebalance to keep your bond holdings a static portion of your portfolio.  So you're going to be buying and selling across the maturity spectrum, being exposed to exactly the same interest rate risk whether you're using a ladder of individual bonds or a bond fund.   There's no difference between the two because a constant duration bond fund is simply a convenient wrapper around the exact same constant duration bond ladder.  

On the other hand if you're investing to fund a known liability at a known date in the future it's optimal to buy either individual bonds that mature on that date or a target maturity bond fund for that date, and you shouldn't rebalance or sell before that date.  In this situation too there's no real difference between using individual bonds or the bond fund (though again it has to be specifically a target maturity bond fund that decreases in duration over time).  

> I expected to see people using VNQ equivalents (RIETs) to expose to real estate markets

Some people do, but you need a good justification for why the amount of REITs already included in VTI is not enough.  We generally follow market cap weights among all other sectors, bogleheads recommend against overweighting healthcare or tech or whatever, so why overweight REITs?  You could argue they're a proxy for the much larger real estate market but the theory gets messy here.  

>  VGT equivalents to speculate on bitcoin

Well speculating on bitcoin is not a boglehead strategy.  But also does VGT even effectively speculate on it?  Why use a sector fund (which again, is pretty inherently un-boglehead) instead of just a bitcoin etf.  If you want something uncorrelated from equities you probably shouldn't invest in equities, even if bitcoin has a painfully high correlation already. 

> Are these “other markets” not worth adding weight into to diversify? 

I'm not sure why you think overweighting a small portion of the equity market would be diversifying.  It's the opposite.  

Some people invest in frontier markets (the category beyond emerging).  That could be justified under a boglehead framework.  Though generally their market cap is so small as to be inconsequential and there are questions about how efficient their markets actually are.",1757978965.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1nhu5ox/diversification_via_etfs/nefmy9w/

VT holds just about ten thousand companies spread across the entire world. ""VCR, VGT, VHT, VOO, VUG"" each hold a couple hundred companies, all US. VT generally contains all the stuff in those other funds, so rather than adding it, you'd replace all that stuff with VT.

> As for the individual stocks, I agree with Ben that it’s highly volatile, but I’m okay with the risk, as he said, could be well worth it. 

This *could* is carrying a lot of weight.

Tilting towards tech, quantum, AI, or [any sector](https://novelinvestor.com/sector-performance/) is not necessary, because sectors outperform in unpredictable ways and the market already has priced in all the available information about future expected performance. Tilting in that way *or towards individual stocks* tends to just introduce [uncompensated risk](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/), which means that you're taking on more risk than investing in a total market index fund, but you can't expect to receive better returns than the market average.

That doesn't mean no one will strike it rich through individual stocks, but it generally means you can't use the same information we all have to do better than the market average.

As an example, a person could do:  
\- 70% in VOO (based on the SP500 index, which is the 500 largest US companies based on Market Cap, but heavily driven by the magnificent 7)... so ""diverse"" but not really that diverse.  
\- 20% in VIOO (600 small-cap U.S. companies, which are likely to have more ""growth"" than large cap)  
..... so now you're at 1,100 companies between two ticker symbols, but all still dependent on 1 countries' economy.. so more diverse but still not really that diverse. An unpredictable leader of one country (cough) creates a lot of uncertainty. Markets react wildly to uncertainty, regardless of who holds office.  
\- 10% VXUS (""TOTAL"" international stock market).. 8600+ companies.  
  
So between these 3 tickers you get 9700 companies, 90% weighted on the U.S. economy with 10% full international for some balance. You can mix and match these ratios however you see fit.

or 100% VT, which holds 10,000 companies. Buy the biggest bucket of the whole world available to us, and just let it earn what it earns. One stop shop.

Maybe mix-in some bonds if you're closing in on the end of your time-horizon (which you’re not at 24).

You'll hear a lot of ""VOO and chill"".. which is far better than trying to pick a few random companies that you think might be bangers, but can still be a little volatile because it's so heavily weighted on the performance of 7 companies in one country (""the magnificent 7"").

There's many ways to skin this cat, and it's all about preference and risk tolerance.

The whole boglehead approach is to minimize taxes, minimize fees, keep as much for yourself as you can, invest in broad-market ETFs or low EPR mutual funds based on your own risk tolerance, and let it do what it do. Be emotionless, be deliberate, be consistent, be disciplined, and be and re-balance 1-2x per year. If you’re a high-earner start paying more attention to taxes, and think about things like REITs, tax-exempt municipal bonds, asset location, real estate syndicates, etc. But for your standard average-income Boglehead, simplicity is key. Simplicity is success.

So, we all sort of do a “forced” DCA every month, right? When we get paid, we invest a portion of the paycheck. We have no other option! That’s fine. In the book “Just Keep Buying” (one of many books where the DCA vs Lump sum debate gets explained) he calls this “forced DCA”. Again, that’s fine. 

But then you also have the issue of a windfall. If you get a lump sum of money that you can invest, then the question is “all at once? Or over time?” This is where the data shows that more often than not, investing it all at once is better (assuming other financial priorities like no bad debt, and emergency funds are covered). 

That said, some argue that to some folks, the fear of dropping a huge amount before a crash can be devastating. That’s… okay I guess? I find it hard for THAT to be the reason to justify DCA’ing something that was already intended to be invested (because then WHEN will you invest it if the markets do crash? Can you time the recovery?), but because personal finance is personal and we are all humans with biases… then fine. If it really makes someone happier to do it in installments so be it.

Tech,Bogleheads,1mvt559,Retirement Portfolio???,n9t3ghs,"The two things that stick out to me are that this seems slightly more overcomplicated than needed, and mildly aggressive for someone a year out from retirement. Looks like the allocation is essentially 55% stock, 28% bonds, 5% gold, and 12% cash(ish). The key once you're retired is sequence of returns risk - if the market drops early on, you'll need to sell more shares to pay your expenses and you will have less left to take advantage of the eventual recovery. However, depending on your age, expenses, and how much you have saved you may need market exposure to avoid the risk of simply not making enough in interest, since lower volatility investments won't give as high a return (often just a little above inflation). You could take a look at target date funds, which automatically rebalance over time to reduce risk as the target date gets closer, to get an idea of what's a typical allocation. The Vanguard 2025 fund, for example, is 50% stocks, 42% bonds, and 8% TIPS (inflation protected bonds).

In terms of overcomplication, you have three stock funds, one that's tilted towards tech, one towards large cap value, and one that covers the S&P500, so tons of overlap between all three. Normal bogle strategy is just to buy the full market (including international, which I don't think you have any of!) rather than trying to pick specific sectors or styles. Buy the haystack, don't hunt for the needles. Recent good performance is not a guarantee of future performance, and chasing recent winners is not a good idea. If you buy everything, you will always have the winners. We all like to think we can predict what will beat the market, but statistically not even the experts can consistently do this.

One very good thing - all of these have pretty low expense ratios so that's awesome. Keep that in mind, no matter what funds you pick!

The ""standard"" bogle three fund portfolio should be fine, just adjust the amount of bonds as appropriate for how much risk you feel is appropriate for how close you are to retirement. The link on the sidebar to ""Building your lazy portfolio"" would be good to look at - these are intended to take you from early career to retirement, since you're toward the later end you may want to tilt a little more conservative but all of them are already fairly so.",1755735244.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1mvt559/retirement_portfolio/n9t3ghs/

Tech,Bogleheads,1mvoq8k,Investment advice for 64 yr old who has retired,n9tknyj,"You are retired and your proposed asset allocation is 70% equities 30% cash and *zero* bonds.

Are you relying on withdrawals from this portfolio to fund your living expenses during retirement? Or do you have other income streams (e.g. Social Security, pension, rental properties) that cover all or nearly all of your living expenses? With such a portfolio I would hope it's the latter.

What is the investment thesis behind your fund selection here? Why these five funds?

Why no bonds? You are relying *entirely* on this 30% cash allocation to shield you from sequence-of-returns risk. What is your plan if and when interest rates decline? Your HYSA will no longer be HY and bond prices will have risen. Do you buy your bond allocation at a price premium? Or do you stay in cash and pray that equities are in a bull run and remain so? The term for this is the cash trap. It's best avoided with a proper bond allocation in one's fixed income portfolio.

There isn't enough information here to discuss taxes. Generally speaking, if you have a sizeable tax-deferred balance and you want to avoid or minimize RMDs then you probably want to devise a Roth conversion strategy before RMDs kick in. But there are many factors to this, such as your other income streams, your tax bracket, etc., so consulting a tax professional would be the best course of action for this.

And then what? Do you need all these dollars in ten years, or are you beginning retirement in ten years?

> 1\. Is 6–7 ETFs overkill or is it good diversification?

It's overkill, not as much about the number of funds, but due to the redundancy of what the funds you mention contain. Have you seen **the** [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio)? It's not the count of *three* funds that's important, it's the three asset classes: Total US, Total International, and Bonds.

You already will own everything with VTI, VXUS, BND. ""Adding"" SCHD, QQQ, VNQ, SMH will *reduce* your diversification and introduce tilts, because they're *all* already contained in VTI.

> 2\. Does SMH make sense, or is it basically redundant with QQQ/VTI?

You don't need SMH. No need to tilt towards tech or semi-conductors, or [any sector](https://novelinvestor.com/sector-performance/), because sectors outperform in unpredictable ways and the market already has priced in all the available information about future expected performance. Tilting in that way tends to just introduce [uncompensated risk](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/), which means that you're taking on more risk than investing in a total market index fund, but you can't expect to receive better returns than the market average.

*Also*, you don't need QQQ. No one needs any concentration in ""the 100 largest (non-financial) companies that happen to trade on the nasdaq exchange"". It's a nonsense index. There's no fundamental reason for that selection criteria to outperform in the future, it only looks attractive because of the last decade of performance. It's only accidentally tech-leaning.

*Also*, REITs are contained in VTI at market weight -- some people do like to hold a REIT tilt, but you can consider it ""not necessary"".

*Also*, SCHD is unnecessary -- [despite dividend fandom](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/18m5g9t/comment/ke3lu4d/), [dividends are not free money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5j9v9dfinQ) (and, it's all in VTI already).",1755642208.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1mutfgi/monthly_investment_plan_any_feedback_will_be/n9m0n2m/

Tech,Bogleheads,1mto9r9,How am I doing?,n9l04yf,">Thoughts on my current selection of funds as well as the allocation percentage? Yes I know I am underweight on ex-US investments and overweighting US investments relative to the market. I did that intentionally.

Ex-US has outperformed US year to date. You are losing a portion of that growth and will continue to lose it whenever ex-US performs better relative to US for as long as you underweight the former. But as you said this is intentional.

>I’d be curious to know if anyone has any other tilt suggestions other than AVUV.

AVDV is the logical pairing with AVUV if you truly believe in the Fama-French CAPM and are dedicated to pursuing the small-cap value premium over the long term. But if this were me, I would not reduce my VXUS allocation to add AVDV; I would carve it out of VOO since you're overweight US. But I also don't pursue factors so ymmv.

>I also don’t really plan on adjusting my allocation percentage too much unless something drastic shifts in the market. 

What is your thought process behind letting ""drastic shifts in the market"" determine your asset allocation? 

Did you prepare your [investment policy statement](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Investment_policy_statement)? If so, what does it say about asset allocation? You should be following the strategy you set forth in your investment policy statement. If you don't have one, then start there.

>I prefer to set it and forget it as much as possible. 

If ""set it and forget it"" is the priority you may want to reevaluate the pros/cons of that four-fund portfolio and instead consider a target-date fund or a two-fund portfolio of VT + BND or BNDW with annual rebalancing. 

>I would be open to bumping down VXUS to really overweight US investments but haven’t really done that because I don’t want to get into a chasing gains mindset. 

You're already chasing gains by overweighting US. You don't need to defend that decision to people in this sub, but it's important to recognize, for yourself, that this is what you are doing. 

>I have no idea if the US will continue to outperform or if ex-US will start to out perform though I feel like it’s probably a good bet that the US will continue to perform will. 

ex-US has already been outperforming US in 2025. YTD, VXUS is up 21% while VTI is up 8%. ex-US has outperformed US many times in the past. We have no way of predicting which one will outperform the other over any given period of time. This is the primary argument against trying to pick winners via over/underweighting.

>Thoughts on the VOO and AVUV pairing? I know AVUV isn’t really part of the Bogle philosophy and does deviate but I did pick AVUV for a few specific reasons which I can explain if anyone is curious.

There are countless threads in this sub from over the years about AVUV, other Avantis and DFA funds, and factor investing in general. While it is not a part of the Bogleheads philosophy, it is to some degree compatible with it and some self-professed Bogleheads are factor investors. As long as you understand the risks as well as the potential upside, then who are we to quibble? Ultimately you have to live with the results of your decisions. 

If you don't understand the theory behind factor investing and are just buying AVUV because content creators told you it's a good fund or that small cap value is the way to go, then I would encourage you to at least listen to the discussion of factor investing between [Paul Merriman](https://youtu.be/oGFRB0T8j_o?si=qVYDrBUkpsIZAxKh) and [Rick Ferri](https://youtu.be/e7_MFyltNt4?si=pODYn7zPDGcmudsD) from the 2023 Bogleheads conference before deciding on a strategy.",1755631442.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1mto9r9/how_am_i_doing/n9l04yf/
Tech,Bogleheads,1mto9r9,How am I doing?,n9n9e30,"Thanks for the thoughtful reply! 

On US vs ex-US, I agree underweighting ex-US means missing upside, but I still see 25% in VXUS as significant even if market weight is ~40%. I could bump it up and might, but that means cutting VOO or AVUV which I’d need to assess whether that aligns with my investment goals. On the flip side, sticking to pure market weight could just as easily mean missing US outperformance. Pointing to VXUS +21% vs VTI +8% YTD feels like the same recency bias you’re warning me against—it cuts both ways.

I passed on AVDV (too expensive and adds too much complexity for me). My 15% AVUV stake is intentional—big enough to matter if small-cap value works, small enough not to derail the plan if it doesn’t. What I really wanted to know was whether people see VOO+AVUV as a solid pairing, or if there’s another US tilt worth considering. That said, I should’ve been clearer—I was really asking for alternatives to AVUV as a US pairing with VOO, not ex-US complements. That’s on me for not wording it better.

My IPS only changes for life events, not market timing. “Set and forget” for me means holding a fixed allocation for decades. I know VT is the purest solution, but I prefer controlling US vs ex-US weight and didn’t think VTI’s extra small/mid exposure moved the needle. AVUV gives me a barbell with VOO plus VXUS for global. 

I also watched the Merriman/Ferri talks you linked—helpful to see both sides. I didn’t know those existed. Appreciate your feedback—it helped me sharpen my reasoning.",1755657657.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1mto9r9/how_am_i_doing/n9n9e30/

For most people, I think this is ultimately part of the glide path of retirement, toward capital preservation and spending instead of accumulation (eg. choosing 60% bonds/cash/fixed income entering retirement). It’s not market timing if you are simply protecting your capital. While employed, you have time for your portfolio to recover, but once retired you don’t really have a decade to come back from a big downturn like the lost decade.

Providing for your investments a few years to recover from a down market allows you to ride it out, use a strategic withdrawal plan based on your different income buckets to suit the market, tax planning, and larger expenses.

Don't let the tax tail wag the investment dog.

Looking at the unrealized gains and a [calculator for capital gains taxes](https://smartasset.com/investing/capital-gains-tax-calculator) can help you understand the tax consequences.

I'd generally recommend to get out of investments you don't want anymore (especially if the tax consequence isn't too large), but if you want to do it slowly to spread out the tax hit (or just get rid of the long-term shares now and wait until the other shares get the long-term capital gains tax treatment), that's reasonable too.

US only is single country risk, which is an *uncompensated* risk. An uncompensated risk is one that doesn't bring higher expected long term returns. Uncompensated risk should be avoided whenever possible. Compensated vs uncompensated risk:

* https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/

* https://www.northerntrust.com/middle-east/insights-research/2024/wealth-management/compensated-portfolio-risk
>But not all risks are compensated with an expected return premium.

>Uncompensated risk is very different; it is the risk specific to an individual company, sector, or country.

Tech,Bogleheads,1mdesuk,How’s my portfolio?,n630af2,"Theoretically better but very similar in practice.

Unlike with QQQ there’s actually good reason to expect future outperformance out of SPMO. In fact, Fama and French won the Nobel prize in Economjcs for their work on capital markets models including compensated risk factors like momentum.

That said, compensated risk factors give you the expectation of return above market beta because they are fundamentally riskier than the market as a whole in one or more ways. Often the outperformance is absent for long periods of time (think decades) or is very hard to capture at a reasonable cost.

People who want to lean into factor investing should have a solid understanding of the theoretical foundations underpinning it and be extremely dedicated to sticking with that tilt for their entire investing career regardless of what returns look like over any ten year or more year timeframe. 

Unfortunately, for SPMO in particular, it’s become a Trendy fund, with its recent popularity largely spurred by a few video finfluencers. As such, most of the people who are piling into it can be expected to not achieve the same long term return as the fund itself.",1753923350.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1mdesuk/hows_my_portfolio/n630af2/

Now, there might be a slight downside - you’re locking it up for five years or so, which could mean less liquidity. But you can still access it but pay the surrender fee, similar how breaking a CD occurs a penalty. But hey, if you’re looking for a safe place to park money then MYGA might be just what you need.  The highest yield right now with a high-grade company is a five-year annuity, which yields 5.75%, which if the Fed is predicted to cut rates then its better to lock in high rates now. Another thing to keep in mind is that annuity products defer taxes.

Two scenarios:

1. Purchase a MYGA within an IRA at any age.  Everything proceeds normally with zero taxation at maturity.  If younger than 59.5, there's a 10% penalty for ANY early distribution from the account, MYGA included.
2. Purchase a MYGA with after-tax $$.  If younger than 59.5 at maturity, and you take the cash out, there will be a 10% penalty on top of the taxes on the interest earned.  This can be avoided by rolling all of the MYGA into a new one.  You can't just roll the interest, the whole thing needs to be rolled.  This can be done indefinitely, but you might roll a 5.7% MYGA into a 1.6% if interest rates plummet.

1. I’m switching to Robinhood Roth IRA as they allow a 3% match on your Roth IRA with their gold subscription. Meaning I can’t even do VFIAX lol

2. For large cap I know VOO is regarded as one of the best. I’d still like to do a bit of growth/risk stuff as I’m still young and am willing to take some drawbacks so that’s why I did QQQ.

3. This is what always confuses me. I know Trad 401k is great as of right now as it saves you a bunch until about 65 on taxes, but then you get taxed heavy once you start taking it out. But with a Roth it’s after tax and no tax when taking it out. Right now I am paying 24% tax so very little and I expect to be paying higher taxes later. So it’s enticing that trad tax break but wouldn’t I be hurt badly at the end? Sorry this part always confuses me.

QQQ does not provide that. 

What QQQ does is remove from VTI companies that are: 

1. In financial services, or
2. Are small cap, or
3. Are listed on the nyse instead of nasdaq

There's no sensical investment strategy that leads to that selection criteria. 

The nasdaq has historically been popular with technology companies, and technology companies have done well the last twenty years, but neither of those things is guaranteed for the future. And in fact, history tells us that chasing these things usually _underperforms_. Here's one good article: https://pwlcapital.com/investing-technological-revolutions/

If you want to take on more risk than a 100% stock portfolio already has (which is [a lot](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1hkmz2w/why_do_people_feel_the_urge_to_sell_during_market/)), a first step might be looking into small caps, since those have higher expected returns (especially [if you avoid growth stocks](https://www.etf.com/sections/index-investor-corner/swedroe-small-cap-growth-anomaly)) to go with higher volatility.

2. VTI is more diversified than VOO for the same expense ratio. There's no promise that the s&p500 outperforms the rest of the US market over any timeframe. QQQ is a nonsense index. it *only* looks good because of past performance, it *doesn't* make more sense when you're young or have a high risk tolerance.
3. Lets talk about marginal tax rates:

When you use traditional, save at your marginal tax rate. When you withdraw in retirement, you fill up the brackets from the bottom up.

You're not ""taxed heavily in retirement"", because your withdrawals first fill the 0% bracket (under the standard deduction), then the 10%, then 12%, then 22% bracket. In a way of thinking about it, you're saving at your marginal tax rate now, and withdrawing at something that looks like your *effective* tax rate.

Your current 24% marginal tax rate is not very little, it's actually an opportunity to save dollars at 24% that you may be able to withdraw at a lower rate, saving you somewhere from 2% to 24% on those dollars.",1752795849.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1m1zyi8/m23_new_job/n3q54r7/

The timing risk is real - if the market tanks right when you want to buy, you could be stuck waiting years for recovery or forced to put down way less than planned.



That said, with a 3-4 year timeline you do have some flexibility. A hybrid approach might work, maybe keep 6-12 months worth of your savings target in VMFXX and put the rest in something like VOO. As you get closer to your purchase timeline, gradually shift more back to cash. VGT is probably too aggressive for house money though, tech can be pretty volatile.



The tax angle is interesting but dont let the tail wag the dog here. The difference between ordinary income tax and long term capital gains might not be as big as you think depending on your bracket, and it definitely shouldn't be the primary factor in this decision.



One thing to consider too is that once you do buy that first home, you'll have built up equity over time that could potentially be leveraged for investment properties down the road.

After 401k Id focus on IRA because you can take out up to what you've contributed penalty free and its also tax advantaged so if you do traditional the contributions can be deducted from your Gross Income for federal taxes or if you do roth its completely tax free at the point of selling it for huge gains (and I believe it makes dividends tax free as well but Im most likely wrong on that when it comes to roth vs traditional, I feel like I read somewhere that dividends are tax deferred for traditional 401ks and IRAs, idk).

1) the market tends to go up over time

2) even if it were to be a ""lost decade"", you've got time to weather it. In fact, a lost decade FOR YOU is really a decade of buying on discount

3) ""Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.""

I'd also recommend you read a bit to understand how psychology and emotions impact investment decision making. You need to fight against how your brain is wired.  Investing is counterintuitive to our emotions and reflexes. You need to retrain your brain.  Removing decisions can help but education and awareness will serve you well too.

How NOT to Invest by Barry Rithotiz.

One last tip, focus not on the share price and value of shares you own short term, but the QUANTITY of shares you are accumulating. Think of them as tiny bits of the entire economy. the value will flex short term, but if you keep accumulating, you will grow your wealth over the long term.

The problem is, everyone does this and if you can figure out it will do well, professional analysts who manage billions of dollars can also. As a result, they have already bid up the price by the time you get there in virtually every case (supply and demand drives prices). So, while you might be getting higher long-term growth on earnings, you are buying less earnings to start with... On average it typically ends up being a wash and adds risk without any reward.

Tech,Bogleheads,1ljsdci,VT / VGT,mzo6ydd,"There are several reasons for not investing in VGT, as others have pointed out:

1. It’s probably the most represented sector in VT, so you’re lowering your diversification as you’re overweighting even more what’s already overweighted.

2. Overweighting sectors, in general, increases your risk without giving you higher expected returns. The explanation is kind of complicated but basically it’s not true that every time you increase your risk you also increase your expected returns. Only systematic risk (that can’t be diversified away) increases expected returns, not risk that comes from concentration. Imagine that you had to bet all of your money in either a coin toss or in ten coin tosses. You get your money plus 20% extra if you win but lose your money if you don’t. If you chose to bet all of your money in one coin toss the risk is higher but your expected returns are the same. As others have pointed out, if you want to increase your risk/reward, this is not the way to go. You can either tilt towards small cap value (AVUV, AVDV) or diversify a little more, but using leverage (NTSX, NTSI, NTSE or RSSB). Those strategies are riskier, so they’re going to underperform during long stretches if time (otherwise they wouldn’t be riskier).

3. Investing in something just because it’s done best in recent times is a bad strategy (10 or even 15 years is recent in market terms). Do some research about the “Roaring 20s”, the “Nifty Fifty”, the “Dot Com Bubble” or about what happened in Japan after the 80s.

4. Even if you think a sector has a lot of potential and that it’s going to change the world, that doesn’t make it a great investment, because all of that may be already be reflected in the price. You only get outsized returns (in the future) if what you invest in performa better than the market already expected when you bought. For example, if you buy a piece of real estate in a great location it can be a bad investment if everyone wants it and that drives its price up. In that case, there could be another building that’s not so hot, but has a better price so by investing in it you eventually make more for every dollar you invested.",1750846246.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1ljsdci/vt_vgt/mzo6ydd/

If the latter you could create your own mix using VTI (S&P500 + extended markets, aka small/mid caps) and VXUS (international, no US). 

If you look at the composition mix of VT/VGT @ 80/20 you end up roughly 70/30 between US & international but more tilted towards tech. As others are telling you tech is already heavily leveraged in all these funds. 

If your goal is to limit international to 20% then simply run an 80/20 using VTI/VXUS and better diversify your risk/reward.

Tech,Bogleheads,1ljhpj1,Too Slicey Dicey for Retirement?,mzlspa2,"So I would start with excluding primary home from asset allocation.  Doing so, your investment portfolio is roughly 27% cash, 22% stocks, 45% bonds, 8% speculative (gold/francs).  

This is extremely conservative.  Ben Graham says that one should never have less than 25% allocated to stocks.  This is because stocks are historically the best hedge to inflation.  Only you can decide your risk tolerance, and if it’s 22% stocks that’s what it is, but I would consider at least bumping this up to 25%, probably closer to 30-40%.  At 72, you could hopefully have 30+ years drawdown.  You want the inflation hedge/growth potential of stocks.  For simplicity, I think VT or some combination of VTI/VXUS if you want different US/Intl split than VT offers.  

On the flip side 27% cash is extremely high. Assuming this is invested into a high yield money market account or something else getting interest. Rather than having a % allocated to cash, you could consider a dollar amount, say 2-3 years in cash.  Not knowing the balances maybe 27% is 2-3 years worth of expenses.  Having 2-3 years of cash can be a nice buffer to prevent selling during extended drawdowns, Great Depression, Financial Crisis, etc.  But again, considering your guaranteed income streams pay all expenses, having this much cash is extremely, extremely conservative.  Maybe worth considering reallocating to higher yielding asset classes, especially if/when interest rates drop and you’re not getting 3.5-4% on cash.  

Speculative asset allocations are a little high and the Swiss francs kind of weird if I’m honest.  Personally I don’t see a need to invest in either, but if you desire I’d limit speculative assets to less than 5%.  Less allocation and positions here is better imo. 

Bonds seem fine.  Since you have corporate bonds and are not excluding them, I would just combine all bond funds into BND since its composition has roughly the same % to corps and probably a similar duration.  If you want shorter duration can still combine BND with 1-2 other shorter terms, but also if you consider your large cash position as a pseudo short term bond you could just keep BND and probably be about the same.  

Considering your expenses are effectively fully covered by guaranteed income, what/who is the portfolio for?  Don’t need to answer here, just a prompt I wanted to suggest to think about.  If it’s additional discretionary income or something you’re planning on using then maybe lean more conservative (although probably not more than currently).  If it’s likely to be for someone else, children inheritance, charity, etc, maybe could go slightly more aggressive (probably not all out aggressive in case you or spouse need for fallback, but you get my point).

To summarize, considering your high guaranteed income, I would first look at your cash position and see how high that needs to be.  Personally I would go with 2-3 years expenses tops and cap it at that.  I would not include this in allocation %, but keep that balance at the 2-3 years.  

From there, we’re looking for a stock/bond allocation.  For stocks, I would bump to at least 25%.  This is risk question only you and spouse can answer, but even upwards of 40-50% in stocks is relatively conservative.  

I’ll let you keep the 5% in speculative assets (gold, francs, artwork, whatever you want), the remaining allocation would go to bonds.

Rough allocation ranges and simplified holdings (again not including home or 2-3 years worth of cash):

25-50% stocks - VT

45-70% bonds - BND

5% speculative/alts - whatever your heart desires",1750808148.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1ljhpj1/too_slicey_dicey_for_retirement/mzlspa2/

This is one of over a dozen links I have that can help explain the reasoning behind that: 

* https://www.pwlcapital.com/should-you-invest-in-the-sp-500-index - invest in the S&P 500, but don't end there (this covers info on both the US extended market and ex-US markets) [a total US market fund combines S&P 500 + extended market into one]

US only is single country risk, which is an *uncompensated* risk. An uncompensated risk is one that doesn't bring higher expected long term returns. Uncompensated risk should be avoided whenever possible. Compensated vs uncompensated risk:

* https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/

* https://www.northerntrust.com/middle-east/insights-research/2024/wealth-management/compensated-portfolio-risk
>But not all risks are compensated with an expected return premium.

* https://www.pwlcapital.com/is-investing-risky-yes-and-no/ (Bold mine)
>Uncompensated risk is very different; it is the risk specific to an individual company, sector, **or country.**

Consider this: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio The bonds are the part that adjust risk level. More bonds equals less risk. Alternatively, a target date (index) fund is effectively the 3 fund concept in a single wrapper, managed for you. They are designed to be ""one and done,"" the only thing you hold. They're fully diversified internally for you. These can be found with expense ratios as low as 0.08%-0.12% for the Fidelity, iShares, Schwab, and Vanguard index based ones. The target date and target allocation funds typically are not recommended for taxable accounts but are fine for tax advantaged.

>What percentage of my Roth IRA portfolio should each of my investments be - please give an example. I want to know what investment should take up a majority and how my money should be distributed. 

Typically for your age for retirement, bonds can be kept low or even 0%. However, no matter what the age or timeline, not everyone can actually stomach a 100% stock based portfolio. The various investing subreddits see it all the time during even moderate drops of people that took on too much risk and want to bail on their strategy. The lucky ones post and get talked out of it before they go through with it. A single behavioral mistake like that could cost you more than the opportunity cost of bonds would.

For US to ex-US (international):

* https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/portfolio/vtwax - Global market cap weights (be sure to switch from “Regions” to “Markets”). This can be a great default position.

Tech,Bogleheads,1lj09fh,Help!! 18M opening a Roth IRA!,mzgjahj,"First, read u/Cruian's comment here. It's full of very useful information and worth reading more than once. As for your questions:

(1) VT and chill. One fund. Low cost. Global diversification. Avoids unnecessary sector risk. It ""automatically rebalances"" so you never have to worry about rebalancing between US and ex-US equities. It's the easy button and is ideally suited for Roth IRA accounts.

(2) 100% VT or perhaps 90% VT 10% BNDW or BND if you desire a small bond allocation. Given you're age 18 either would be reasonable here.

(3) Your annual contributions cannot exceed the lesser of (1) the IRS limit, presently $7,000/year or (2) your total earned income for the year. First, come up with a personal budget. The Boglehead wiki page on making a [household budget](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Household_budgeting) could be helpful here, although of course your finances likely are more simple right now. But the principle still applies: First, open a Google Sheet or even just take out a pencil and paper and draft your budget to see how much is coming in, how much is going out, and where it's going right now. Otherwise you're just driving at night in the dark with no headlights on here.

Once you have a budget that tells you roughly where the money's going, figure out how much you can save (and where you can cut spending to improve your savings rate) and see how close you can come to maxing out that $7,000 Roth IRA contribution. You then could either divide up the planned contribution into bi-weekly contributions or save it up in a checking/savings account and push that sum into the Roth IRA monthly or at the end of the summer. There's no one correct way; any of these work.

(4) Yes. Max out the Roth IRA each year before contributing to the taxable brokerage account. There are several reasons for this: First, the Roth IRA's tax advantages are very powerful. The money is taxed once, in the year that you earned it, and then once in the account all of the growth that contribution generates is tax free and your withdrawals from the account in retirement are tax free. Second, there's a time limit in play here -- you only get the opportunity to contribute so much to a Roth IRA each year and every dollar under the $7,000 limit that you do not contribute is a missed opportunity, the cost of which is losing out on that tremendous tax-free growth. Third, if you do suffer a hardship and exhaust your emergency fund, then if push comes to shove you can always withdraw your Roth IRA *contributions* (not the gains) without penalty. That isn't ideal, and it's better to have a well-stocked emergency fund (and prudent insurance policies, down the road when you're in your 20s and older) to avoid having to raid your retirement accounts, but it's there if you need it. So, max Roth IRA before taxable.",1750739846.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1lj09fh/help_18m_opening_a_roth_ira/mzgjahj/

> I’ve heard about VTI, VXUS, VOO, QQQ, SCHD, and all of those

It's really important to not just invest in a collection of tickers that you read good things about, but to understand what the funds own. Not all ETFs are equally sensible.

VTI is total US, a great fund, covers the first asset of the three fund portfolio.

VXUS is total international, a great fund, covers the second asset class of the three fund portfolio. 

VOO is s&p 500, which is totally contained inside a VTI, and will basically behave the same as VTI, since the s&p 500 is over 80% of the US market.

QQQ is ""the 100 largest (non-financial) companies that happen to trade on the nasdaq exchange"". There's no fundamental reason for that selection criteria to outperform in the future, it only looks attractive because of the last decade of performance. This is also fully contained inside of VTI, no one needs any extra of this.

SCHD is a dividend focused fund, but [despite dividend fandom](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/18m5g9t/comment/ke3lu4d/), [dividends are not free money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5j9v9dfinQ), even though it can be [hard to convince someone who is convinced of income investing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGgpGP3swmE&t=445s).

Total market funds, like VTI + VXUS are great. It is impossible to know which specific funds will do better in the future. A very common behavioral mistake is to select funds based on past performance. You can *always* look backwards and find a fund that did better than the market average, but looking backwards is not a crystal ball to see which fund will do better in the *future*.

> What percentage of my Roth IRA portfolio should each of my investments be

Consider taking a look at a target date fund [glide path](https://institutional.vanguard.com/investment/strategies/tdf-glide-path.html) to get a reasonable starting point for an asset allocation that makes sense for your age, for just use a target date fund directly.

Target date funds are self-contained, automatically rebalancing, globally diversified portfolios of stocks and bonds, where the bond allocation increases as you age.

If you don't want any bond allocation right now, you can just use a single ETF: VT which holds US + international at global market weight (approximately 60% US, 40% international, at the moment), or you can hold US and international individually with 60% VTI (or FZROX) + 40% VXUS (or FZILX).

> How much of my paycheck should I be contributing to the Roth IRA given that I currently have little to no expenses (I do plan to go to college however).

See if you can set aside at least 15% of your gross income towards retirement. You're starting very early, and you may have other demands on your money, so if you can get started with a Roth IRA even with a smaller amount: that's great, still a victory.

> Should I always max out my Roth before investing in a taxable brokerage? 

Yes. [Prioritizing investments](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Prioritizing_investments) into tax advantaged accounts first is the best plan.


> This always confuses me because it feels like I should have some money more liquid than it is in a Roth so that I can withdraw it without early withdrawal penalties.

You can always withdraw up to the amount of contributions from a Roth IRA without penalty, but you really shouldn't treat the Roth IRA like a savings account for near-term expenses. 

It's much better to plan for near term expenses and keep them separately, in a cash equivalent like HYSA, CD, money market fund, or Treasury ETF (like USFR, TFLO, SGOV, BIL). Then you invest the money that you're not going to need soon, and you make those investments inside the most tax advantaged accounts you have. Investing is a long-term project, for money you can put away for decades, because the market is volatile, and it's not for money you're going to need soon.",1750767733.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1lj08t3/help_18m_looking_to_open_a_roth_ira/mzi0xs8/

I think one of the keys for a custodial account is tax GAIN harvesting.  Depending upon the size of the account, gains might be 1) Not reportable, 2) Taxed at a child rate, or 3) Taxed at parent rate if the gain is >$2700... I think this last number is correct for the year.

Here's an example allocation. I've removed all the redundant stuff, swapped in a few better versions of the rest, but hopefully kept the ""vibe"". The core allocation is not exact and should be market weighted; all that's important is not letting the 5% and 15% sleeves balloon beyond that.


You should really consider adding bonds. Even 10% will noticeably reduce volatility.

### Core - 80%


- 50% VTI
- 30% VXUS


Very approximate allocations; check the Bogleheads Wiki for the right ones.


### Tilt Sleeve - 15%


- 3% VGT. Possibly the best of the tech tilted ETFs you've mentioned.
- 3% VNQ. Vanguard real estate; does what it should.
- 3% VYM. Vanguard's more well-rounded SCHD alternative. Your dividend tilt.
- 3% PAVE. Swap for VBLD for global, not US infrastructure tilt.
- 3% GLDM. It tracks the same gold as GLD, but with an 0.1%, not 0.4% expense ratio. This is pretty important in the long term for a static asset like gold.


### Play Money - 5%


- 2.5% BLK - Blackrock
- 2.5% NOC - Northrop-Grumman

No. There will always be one part of the market doing better than others.

In a properly diversified portfolio, there will always be some parts over performing and others under performing. The thing is, which parts those are will change from time to time. It is better to always have part of your portfolio under performing than to sometimes have your entire portfolio under performing.

Then we have things like valuations, which don't only not favor QQQ over the rest of US, they don't favor the US over international.

You've got a couple versions of the S&P500, which is pretty close to total US, but if you have an extended market fund available in some of those accounts, you could complete the US market by holding that at a ratio of 4:1 (S&P500 to US Extended Market).

Some international (like 20 - 40% of your total equities) would be a good idea, since International and US have [cycles of outperformance](https://www.mymoneyblog.com/us-vs-international-stocks-cycles-outperformance.html) compared to each other.

QQQM: You don't need any concentration in ""the 100 largest (non-financial) companies that happen to trade on the nasdaq exchange"". There's no fundamental reason for that selection criteria to outperform in the future, it only looks attractive because of the last decade of performance.

VGT: No need to tilt towards tech, or [any sector](https://novelinvestor.com/sector-performance/), because sectors outperform in unpredictable ways and the market already has priced in all the available information about future expected performance. Tilting in that way tends to just introduce [uncompensated risk](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/), which means that you're taking on more risk than investing in a total market index fund, but you can't expect to receive better returns than the market average.

AAPL, AMZN, BRKB: Investing in single company stock also increases uncompensated risk. These three companies are well represented already in total US/S&P500.

IBIT: zero crypto would be a great amount of crypto.

Consider keeping the sum total of all these bets to less than 5% of your portfolio.

>Cash is in HYSA/CD accounts for emergency. Considering current job market conditions, I thought it’s good to have emergency funds for at least 2-3 yrs.

ok -- cash equivalent like HYSA, CD, Money Market Fund, T-Bills, or [treasury floating rate note ETF](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/11prp0b/hysa_mmf_cds_tbills_searching_for_the_best_return/) are a reasonable choice for emergency fund.

Tech,Bogleheads,1l45c7t,Review my allocations; slightly unconventional Boglehead?,mw7nbmf,"> QQQ... because I’m bullish on tech

You don't need any concentration in ""the 100 largest (non-financial) companies that happen to trade on the nasdaq exchange"". There's no fundamental reason for that selection criteria to outperform in the future, it only looks attractive because of the last decade of performance. It's only accidentally a tech-leaning fund, but no need to tilt towards tech, or [any sector](https://novelinvestor.com/sector-performance/), because sectors outperform in unpredictable ways and the market already has priced in all the available information about future expected performance. Tilting in that way tends to just introduce [uncompensated risk](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/), which means that you're taking on more risk than investing in a total market index fund, but you can't expect to receive better returns than the market average.


> VBR... like the idea of small cap tilt because of my investment horizon being ~30 years.

Tilts aren't necessary, but if you want a [Small Cap Value Tilt](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/s/lLpkHcWAR4), you should be prepared to hold it for decades, because it could take a long time for the SCV premium to show up, if it exists. Of any tilt, SCV may be the most common among bogleheads.

> 50% VTI 20% VXUS 10% QQQ 10% VBR 10% BND

10% bonds is reasonable even 30 years from retirement.

70% US, 20% International (for you 90% equities) is reasonable, any you could consider a little higher international, since the global market weight is about 60% US to 40% International.

Tech,Bogleheads,1kz0klp,For Americans: The famous first 100k ... does it include Roth Ira / 401k or is it pure stocks ?,mv1pmpm,"First, you’re attributing undue importance to a pithy aphorism. It’s trivially true that for any X “the first X dollars are the hardest.” That’s simply the inevitable result of compounding. It doesn’t make that milestone \*important\*.

Second, you’re confusing / misusing investment terminology. 

* Bogleheads typically invest stocks (ownership shares of a company) and bonds (promises to repay a loan by paying interest over a defined period of time then paying back the principal). Those are called asset classes because they represent distinct kinds of things that have value. Other asset classes would include things like real estate or commodities (precious metals, oil, grain, pork bellies, or most anything else with tangible value but that isn’t itself productive)

* When buying these assets Bogleheads generally prefer to invest in funds, legal entities in which multiple investors collaborate to purchase ownership stakes in multiple assets at once through the actions of a fund manager following a specific plan or prospectus. 

* Specifically, Bogleheads invest in funds that are passively managed which is when the prospectus calls for the manager to try to match the performance of an “index” representing the performance of a broad portion of a market, often all of it, rather than trying to pick specific investments in an attempt to outperform the market.

* The most common types of funds for Bogleheads to buy are open end mutual funds (typically just called mutual funds) and exchange traded funds (ETFs). The difference between these two comes down to how the shares are created, traded, and destroyed/redeemed and is has relatively little impact on a long term, “buy and hold” investor. (There are also close end funds used for investments like private equity investments that Bogleheads shun due to their fees and lack of liquidity$

* These funds can be held in a variety of different accounts, the distinctions between which are most commonly based on “tax advantage.” That is to say, various governments offer tax incentives to invest and save for goals such as retirement or education due to the socially desirable nature of this action, especially in reducing the need for government support in the future.

* Each kind of tax advantaged account has its own rules regarding contributions, how they are taxed, and how/when they may be withdrawn from. The most common names you’ll see thrown around have a bias toward the American tax code due to the population of the subreddit and would include 401ks, 403bs, 457s, 529s (all named after a section of the internal revenue code), Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs), and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). Those are just the common U.S. ones. In the anglophone world outside the U.S. you’d also run into Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs), Individual Savings Accounts (ISA), and Superannuation funds (Supers). All of these accounts can be compared to ordinary brokerage accounts without any tax advantages, often referred to as taxable accounts or just “taxable.”

* Within these kinds of tax advantaged accounts, in the U.S. there is a distinction between the type of tax advantage the government gives the account holder that is often prepended onto the name of the kind of account. When the government does not tax contributions to the account as income but taxes withdrawals as income that’s referred to as a “traditional” tax advantaged account since that was the first, and for a long time only, kind of tax advantage the government gave. In the late 1990s, Senator William Roth championed legislation to create a second kind of tax advantage in which the government would tax contributions as income but not tax withdrawals. These kinds of accounts became known as “Roth” accounts.

* Importantly, traditional and Roth are modifiers that can apply to multiple types of accounts including 401ks, 403bs, 457s, and IRAs. However, when seen in isolation, Roth is typically assumed to refer to a Roth IRA

So your question really isn’t actually valid: not only does it refer to a milestone that’s not actually important beyond psychologically, it’s conflating two entirely different types of things, asset class and the US-centric tax advantage type applied to a handful of specific kinds of tax advantaged accounts.

Like in my case, in Finland, I pay about 7% of my paycheck into the pension scheme, which is matched by a \~twice as large contribution from my employer. In return, a certain percentage of my salary is converted to an accumulated pension.

After paying that money into the system, I can't really regard it as my personal portfolio, rather there's just an accumulated monthly pension which I can track. That accumulated pension is however considered to fall under the constitutional protection of private property, so in that sense it's ""mine"".

If I work until full retirement age, the pension will easily support me, so in that sense I think of it as my core retirement income source and, I guess, equivalent to an IRA/401k for an American.

On top of that I have my private investments, which I guess are then similar to what Americans might have in their taxable accounts. Though Europeans have accumulative funds and ETF's which allow tax-free reinvestment of dividends, so if you buy and hold it works like a tax-deferred investment.

I wouldn't sell any VOO shares in a taxable account with unrealized gains (short-term or long-term) in order to buy VTSAX instead. The two should have very similar returns, so this isn't worth the tax cost.

>moving more of savings/VMFXX into some VXUS/SGOV

VMFXX and SGOV are very similar; no real point to switching. Depending on your HYSA yield, it might be slightly advantageous to move whatever you want to keep as an emergency fund from your HYSA to VMFXX or SGOV or VBIL. Whatever you don't want kept as an emergency fund should probably move from VMFXX/HYSA to VXUS.

>Do I get rid of some VGT to accomplish either? 

Given this is in an IRA, you have freedom to make changes with no tax implications. Probably makes sense to use this to round out your portfolio asset allocation to reach your target via switching it to VTI, VXUS, or BND. (The non-Roth / tax-deferred IRA is a decent place to keep bonds from a tax efficiency perspective.)

Remember that the important part about **the** [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) is not the count of three funds, it's the three asset classes: Total US, Total International, and Bonds.

So, what do you have here?

QQQ is ""the 100 largest (non-financial) companies that happen to trade on the nasdaq exchange"". There's no fundamental reason for that selection criteria to outperform in the future, it only looks attractive because of the last decade of performance. It accidentally happens to tilt towards tech, so it has recent outperformance because of US large cap, and growth, and tech, but it's honestly a nonsense criteria for an index and no one needs it.

XLV is a health sector fund. The problem with tilting towards health care, or tech, or [any sector](https://novelinvestor.com/sector-performance/), is that sectors outperform in unpredictable ways and the market already has priced in all the available information about future expected performance. Tilting in that way tends to just introduce [uncompensated risk](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/), which means that you're taking on more risk than investing in a total market index fund, but you can't expect to receive better returns than the market average.

Finally: even a self-proclaimed gold proponent [would limit it to 10%](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1kia4ft/comment/mre7gnb/) of the portfolio.

VOO, VGT: these are all invested in real companies: with real employees, products, CEOs, balance sheets, earnings projections, etc. That's why people invest in the stock market, because there's something *real* driving the growth of their money.

BTC has none of those: it's just a digital entity, but really it has no value in a sense. Crypto banks on the [greater fool theory](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-brutal-truth-about-bitcoin/): you buy it now hoping someone will buy it from you for more money in the future. People tout it as a currency, but it's not widely in use, and anyway its price is *way* too volatile to act as a currency.

BTC is a complete and total gamble, literally. It has obviously paid off so far. But ultimately bogleheads are not interested in something which has no intrinsic value, we're interested in stocks which do have intrinsic value.

Tech,Bogleheads,1kig6jt,Wrong investing choices 15M?,mrfkwfn,"Start here: [If You Can – by William Bernstein](https://www.etf.com/docs/IfYouCan.pdf). IMO, it’s one of the best short guides for young investors.

The ""safest"" investments, like Treasury bonds, don’t pay high returns. They’re safe because they’re backed by the U.S. government, but that safety comes with lower rewards. Stocks, on the other hand, are riskier: companies can rise or fall, but over time, you get rewarded for taking that risk through higher returns.

When we invest, we’re looking for ""risk premiums"": the extra reward you get for taking on certain kinds of risk. Productive, uncorrelated assets (like stocks vs. bonds) offer those. But some things don’t:

* Gold isn’t productive: it just sits there. It doesn’t earn profits or pay dividends. Some investors like it because it’s less tied to stocks or bonds, but long-term, it doesn’t really grow.
* Bitcoin also isn’t productive, and unlike gold, it appears highly correlated with tech stocks. That means you’re not getting extra diversification or safety by adding it.

Now, here’s a key idea:

There are ""compensated risks"" (risks you’re paid to take, like owning stocks) and ""uncompensated risks"" (risks you take for no extra reward, like betting on one sector or one company).

For example: if you own stock in just Bob’s Widgets, you’re exposed to Bob’s mistakes or bad luck. But if you own *all* the widget companies, and Bob’s Widgets goes bankrupt, Alice’s, Carl’s, and Diane’s Widgets will likely fill the gap. That’s *diversification*: it removes the uncompensated risk of individual blowups.

It’s tempting to chase what’s hot, like tech or the U.S. market, especially since they’ve done really well over the past 15 years. But remember: you’re investing for the next 70+ years. Look back 70 years (or even just 25, to the dot-com crash) and you’ll see waves of U.S. vs. international dominance, tech vs. other sectors, booms and busts. The key is to build a balanced portfolio and stick with it through the ups and downs.

Golds been on a tear but for the last 30 years plus it is one of the biggest lagging assets. Maybe you could argue the store of wealth angle or hedge but I don’t know anyone who thinks of it as an investment the same as securities.

The major etfs discussed on here are popular for a reason they are easy to invest in also they are actual companies making things and services so there’s a lot of intrinsic value in that alone. They’re not as volatile as BTC and have performed better in the long term than gold or other alternatives.

Tech,Bogleheads,1kcdgbs,Roth IRA vs Brokerage Allocation,mq2tfun,"> 40% VOO 25% VXUS 25% QQQM 10% SCHD

Have you read about the [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio)
of total US + total International + Bonds?

VOO (S&P500) is reasonably close to the total US market, but you could just use VTI (total US) to get the extra diversification for no additional expense ratio.

VXUS is great for total international. The actual global market weight is about 63% US, 37% International at the moment, so you could even have a higher weight of international.

QQQM is ""the 100 largest (non-financial) companies that happen to trade on the nasdaq exchange"". There's no fundamental reason for that selection criteria to outperform in the future, it only looks attractive because of the last decade of performance. You don't need any of this. It overlaps significantly with VOO (around 50%, I think), and would be contained inside of VTI.

SCHD is a dividend focused fund that is also contained inside VTI, and [despite dividend fandom](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/18m5g9t/comment/ke3lu4d/), [dividends are not free money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5j9v9dfinQ), so you don't need to tilt towards dividends at all.

In a Roth IRA, you can exchange all your investments without tax consequences if you'd like to simplify what you have already to just VTI + VXUS, or you could just use VT alone (total world, like holding VTI + VXUS at global market weight).

Your taxable account can hold the same stuff as your Roth IRA, and VTI + VXUS would be an excellent choice.

Before going to hard into a taxable account, make sure you're first [prioritizing investments](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Prioritizing_investments) into tax advantaged accounts (maxing out Roth IRA, making use of workplace retirement accounts like 401k, using an HSA if it's offered with your insurance).

> Or stick with individual stocks

No need. Investing in single company stock exposes you to [uncompensated risk](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/), which means that you're taking on more risk than investing in a total market index fund, but you can't expect to receive better returns than the market average.

You shouldn't take large risks, but you also don't need to be 100% in bonds.

Given your risk aversion, I would suggest considering a bond-heavy allocation, where you can maybe put a bit in index funds (say, up to 30%), but keep the rest in bonds.

To hedge against US-driven volatility in the stock market, I would make sure to invest both domestically and internationally - look at a combination of VTI + VXUS (maybe 60/40 split, or just buy VT which will handle the split for you with a total market weighted allocation).

For bonds, you can consider both treasuries as well as municipal bonds in a taxable account. You might be more comfortable buying specific, individual bonds with a known maturation date and quantity instead of a general bond fund, which may be subject to unusually high volatility over the coming years. If you're in exceptionally good health, you could consider some longer-term bonds (10-20 years) for a portion of your bond holdings, but otherwise I would probably go for a range of 1-5 year bonds in case you need the money sooner for health, travel, or family reasons.

To be fair, the conclusion doesn’t conclude that it’s safe ( meaning it never fails ) but that it is more safe than alternatives, including holding bonds. Also, to my previous comment, the conclusion specifically mentions that an

Let's extend Cedarburg's logic. Since he is confident that stocks will outperform bonds, then he must also be confident that some stocks will outperform other stocks. US > ex-US? Large  > small cap?

The extreme version of this is just buy the next NVDA, 150x returns in the past decade

Or buy the next AAPL, 80x returns in past 2 decades, and then switch to NVDA

Wait, he wants to max retirement, so buy the next AMZN, 1500x returns in the past 3 decades, then switch to the next AAPL, then switch to the next NVDA

Why bother with the other 500-3,500 other US stocks, when you only need to hop from the best one to the best one per decade?

That combined with lots of compute allowed them to simulate thousands of years of markets against a wide variety of portfolios in dozens of countries. By doing so they were able to do a comparative analysis using actual pricing trends against actual portfolios. 

In response to feedback, they also explored a variety of variables like how the dominance of the US market effects what ‘international’ and ‘domestic’ means as well as US exceptionalism, and the diversification strength of  trying rations of domestic and international equities and portfolios with bonds. 

Bonds, over the long term, did not provide the diversification benefit and drawdown protection as well as diversifying to significant international allocations of equities, no matter which country you started in. 

It’s of course true that the past doesn’t predict the future but you’re ignoring the irony of saying that and defending traditional bond allocations — you’re using the exact same defense but in the absence of rigor.

Tech,Bogleheads,1jvo9cq,Is SGOV a good replacement for BND?,mmc4uiy,"Although the financial shorthand passed around is “bonds are safer than stocks,” which is often shortened even further to “bonds are safe,” this obscures the fact that bonds have risk and that risk varies by duration. Long bonds are riskier and generally have higher returns (unless the yield curve is inverted as it was recently). Shorter term bonds are less risky, but generally lower return. And very short term treasury notes give similar returns to cash in a HYSA: that’s what’s in your money market account.

The general advice is to match your bond duration to your investment horizon: if you need the money soon, BND is not a great idea. IMHO, one downside to the simplicity of the 3 fund portfolio mantra is that it glosses over the risks of bonds and their different durations. (Bonds can also be counterintuitive to grasp at first since price is inverse to yield.) Maybe it should be 3+1 portfolio, to remind people to consider how much cash (in HYSA, MMF, or short treasuries) they should have. And some investors, especially in the accumulation phase, forego long bonds altogether, although that gets them excommunicated from boglehead-dom.",1744259160.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1jvo9cq/is_sgov_a_good_replacement_for_bnd/mmc4uiy/
Tech,Bogleheads,1jvo9cq,Is SGOV a good replacement for BND?,mmbyt13,"30 day SEC yield for SGOV is 4.18% and for BND is 4.33%. But that said, even when SGOV is higher (e.g., when the yield curve is inverted), it’s not ideal for a longer term bond holding. The yield over time will generally be lower than BND, with less volatility in the price.

Bond investing is much more complex than picking the fund with the highest short term yield. If you switch between funds when the yield changes, you’ll lose money due to changes in price. To maximize yield and avoid interest rate risk (price volatility), you want to match the bond fund’s duration to a target date when you need the money.

Also, attempting to invest more in bonds now because you perceive the market to have more downside is a form of market timing. Changing your allocation based on factors that are already priced into the market will reduce return and increase portfolio volatility in the long run. Pick a bond allocation that matches your tolerance for risk in the long run, and stick with it. Stocks have occasionally crashed 50% before recovering.

So if you put bonds in your ROTH IRA the balance will end up lower but you avoid taxes on dividends over time. If you put stocks in your ROTH IRA then you get tax free growth on the larger growth of stocks.",1743610122.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1jpq7es/question_on_how_dividends_affect_total_return_in/ml1l3xi/
Tech,Bogleheads,1jng1u5,"New to IRA, Need Help",mkjhq1j,">  VOO, VGT and VXUS

VOO (s&p500) and VGT (tech) [overlap](https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php) by 30%.

No need to tilt towards tech, or [any sector](https://novelinvestor.com/sector-performance/), because sectors outperform in unpredictable ways and the market already has priced in all the available information about future expected performance. Tilting in that way tends to just introduce [uncompensated risk](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/uncompensated-risk/), which means that you're taking on more risk than investing in a total market index fund, but you can't expect to receive better returns than the market average.

Rather than VOO + VGT, consider maybe VTI (total US market)?

> I'm thinking of adding either BND+BNDX or simply a Target Retirement Mutual Fund as the ""bond allocation,""

BND alone, or BND + BNDX would be a fine thing to add for bonds and complete your [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio)
of total US + total International + Bonds.

You usually wouldn't *add* a Target Date Fund, but rather use a TDF in place of all these other funds. The TDF is a fully complete, self-contained, three-fund-style portfolio all in one fund.

> Should I add different ETFs or am I pretty diversified enough already?

More diversification doesn't come from more funds. Replacing VOO + VGT with VTI would get you more diversification.

> I was planning on eventually opening a brokerage account too, in order to have funds with the availability to withdraw. If I do this, should it mirror my Roth IRA?

You can hold the same three-fund style portfolio in Roth IRA and in taxable (*and* in 401k). Due to the wash sale rule on tax loss harvesting, it can make sense to not hold the exact same tickers in both accounts, so sometimes people hold VT in Roth IRA (that's like a combination of VTI + VXUS at global market weight) and then hold VTI and VXUS in taxable. If the taxable account is for a specific non-retirement goal you might want to hold less stocks and more bonds (and/or especially very short term bonds that are acting as a cash equivalent).

Also: maybe this doesn't apply to your thinking, but whenever someone words things like you have, I feel compelled to remind them: [early retirees should still max out retirement accounts](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/early-retirees-max-out-retirement-accounts/) since there are [ways to access those accounts early](https://www.madfientist.com/how-to-access-retirement-funds-early/)",1743352636.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1jng1u5/new_to_ira_need_help/mkjhq1j/

Yup, a fully complete [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio).

> Could I mirror this for a nonretirement account, or would it be better to acquire a mutual fund alone as my nonretirement investment?

Yes, you could use these same funds in a regular taxable brokerage account.

It's equally fine to use the equivalent three in-house mutual fund equivalents at your brokerge, as seen in that three-fund link.

> Can I assume that if I aim for a nonretirement fund, I'd be better off with a non-TDF mutual fund?

TDF are not perfect for a taxable brokerage accounts because of the way they have to send you taxable distributions from their internally realized capital gains and bond allocation. Also, you won't get the foreign tax credit in taxable unless you own the international fund separately.

So, in taxable, generally it's better to the three-funds separately, either as ETFs or Index Mutual Funds.

> If so, what are some recommended mutual funds I can choose from?

Again: the three-fund portfolio link. That can be the whole list, you don't need to start there and add more, you can start there and as you learn more you're likely find that you can end there too. More funds doesn't give you more/better diversification.",1743455252.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1jng1u5/new_to_ira_need_help/mkr372y/

Dividend investing, tilting to tech, and buying individuals stocks are not adding anything to your portfolio.

If you live well below your means and invest in tax advantaged accounts you could be able to retire when you hit 59½.

Going off this pdf from the Money Guy Show [https://moneyguy.com/resource/how-much-to-save/](https://moneyguy.com/resource/how-much-to-save/) you would need to save 30% of your pre-tax income to replace your income at retirement.

Regarding international:  
I feel as though currently the international indices are overhyped due to recent market trends (and as such are also relatively expensive). But I believe to be what I mentioned it to be - a trend. Long term investing shows consistently much higher returns on US growth indices than international indices. Given all that I've decided to opt out of international indices.

Regarding BRK:  
While BRK is a single stock, it is a highly diversivied holding company which holds many different stocks. Historically, it seems to have performed (give or take) just as good as the S&P500, while being less volatile during recessions or dips (look at the recent month).

“Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face."" -- Mike Tyson

u/longshanksasaurs has explained the merits of the three-fund portfolio, the concepts of compensated vs. uncompensated risk, and the concept of a portfolio tilt and the need to hold a tilt for decades if you decide to do it. All of that advice is sound and you'd do well to learn more about it. But start by learning about yourself and your own appetite/aversion to risk, to make sure you have treated the question of asset allocation with the seriousness it deserves. If you aren't amenable to that kind of introspection and careful analysis, then you're likely best served by putting 100% of your portfolio into a target-date fund and letting the fund handle asset allocation and rebalancing for you.
