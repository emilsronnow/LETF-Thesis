Some of their comments will contain half truths, others will be a complete waste of the electricity used to store them on reddit servers.

Here are the truths:

* LETFs do amplify the returns you get.
* LETFs do reset daily.
* LETFs do diverge from the returns of the underlying index over time, both to the positive and negative sides.

You aren’t missing anything but you have to understand that last bullet point.  If you buy a LETF now and the index declines it is going to take you longer to recover than it will take the index to recover.  That’s how LETFs diverge from their underlying index due to the fact that they reset daily.  Ultimately that is all the result of the amplification of LETFs.

In your case, 40+ years, that isn’t a real problem.  Even if you buy at the all time high and the index takes a dump you will ultimately recover and outperform the index unless the index flatlines for those 40 years or has multiple major corrections.  The chance the index will do that is basically zero when you are talking about a major index like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, or Dow Jones Industrials.

There is a risk in holding LETFs for the long term but there is a risk with anything, so you aren’t really increasing your risk if you buy a LETF which is based on a major index. The real challenge with LETFs is the human.  Take for example, the recent market drops in 2025 and  2022.  In both those drops if you had held onto a LETF which you bought in 2018, you would have seen it drop below your original investment baseline.  The vast majority of people in such a situation would absolutely panic and sell and, of course, on both occasions they would have realized a loss and not participated in the subsequent recovery.

The question with LETFs isn’t whether or not they can be a viable investment vehicle.  The question is, do you have the right time horizon (yes, you do) and do you have the emotional fortitude to stomach future corrections?  So you need to ask yourself what you would do if you put $20,000 in a LETF to see that rise to $100,000 and then fall to $10,000.  There’s a very good chance that will happen.  If you are 100% certain you will not panic sell then you are a candidate for using LETFs.

However, sitting in SPXL is a terrible idea. 

First, look up volatility decay. You get approximately 3x the DAILY return. This could be wildly different from the yearly. For example, in the last year the S&P is up 14% and SPXL is up 22%. 

You will get nothing like 40% appreciation. Even if the S&P returned 13% over the long term, which it has not historically and is incredibly unlikely to do in the future, you won’t get 40%. See above. 

Second, you are likely to get wiped out. If the market is down 30%, which it is periodically, you will be down 90% if not get totally wiped out. 

Third, most people simply can’t stomach volatility like that. So even if somehow everything worked beautifully, you, statistically speaking, are likely to panic when the inevitable 60% drop comes and sell out. 

All that said, if you just took out a margin loan for like 25-30% of your SPY position and used it to buy more SPY you probably would end up with a better result than buy and hold.

# Lifecycle Investing: A New, Safe, and Audacious Way to Improve the Performance of Your Retirement Portfolio

Ian Ayres and Barry Nalebuff

In my experience, nakedly investing in leveraged index ETFs works until it doesn't.  That is, you can have tremendous gains, but then give them all back.  You need to have some portion of the portfolio that is a hedge and rebalance a couple times a year.  Hedges are long treasuries (ZROZ), gold (GLDM) and potentially managed futures (CTA).  

Play around with different mixes on testfol.io.  Really look closely at the 1970s or 2007/8 and consider your total leverage (amount of UPRO or SPUU) in the mix.  It isn't going to be hard to run a leveraged portfolio in times like today.  But imagine things going down and staying down for five years or longer.  That will happen.  It's guaranteed over your investing lifespan.  Multiple times.  Whatever portfolio you run, you need to believe in it strongly enough by doing the work so that you stick with it when the shit hits the fan.  Which it will.",1756957425.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n7uw7b/whats_wrong_with_a_23_year_old_investing_into_a/ncbc969/

Lets say you decide to put X dollars in TQQQ in 1999 (it didn't exist then, but lets pretend). Then the 2000 thing happened. 

The Nasdaq 100 dropped about 83%.

Now for the fun part. Triple -83% is ________?

Lets do the same thing in 2008.

QQQ (which did exist -- not TQQQ) dropped about 42% in 2008.

Triple -42% is __________. 


Lets say a person hypothetically started putting 1000/month dollars away in TQQQ (which didn't exist then) in 1970. By 2008, you would have ZERO dollars. 

38 years of investing and you would be at zero dollars.

To be fair, if you did that up until today, you would have about a million bucks if you invested 1000/month since its inception date in 2010. So... in 2025 you would have just over a million bucks if you followed this strategy like a religion. 

Had you been investing in a hypothetical SPY from 1970 on the same amount, you would have several million.

To be clear, we can really use any starting date before 2000, as you would be zeroed out with that bubble and then again in 2008. Oh... yeah, you would have been wiped out in 1987, as well.

The debate in this sub on use of leverage tends to be about leverage efficiency. I think that many people in this sub that use leverage tend to prefer to use futures instead of letfs or margin.

I can see an argument for using letfs though. There are a few strategies that can be easier to implement with letfs than with futures.

Although - if someone didn't want to use futures - I think you can accomplish more efficient leverage borrowing via a box to leverage instead of using letfs.

Yes, economics tells you that you can do fancy shit to offset your risks and get technically better results by playing around with leverage and adjusting your ratios.

It aims for three times return, it doesn’t always hit it. Not only do you get exposed to the negatives but on an annualized basis, you can end up dramatically worse. QQQ is down 2% on the year, TQQQ more than 17%. TQQQ is more accurate in matching QQQ on a day-to-day basis and that has consequences 

It should also be noted that TQQQ was never meant to be a “buy and hold” product for every day investors. It’s the type of thing professional traders buy when sensing a big movement and sell out before it’s too late.

If QQQ goes down 30% and up 50% on the next day, TQQQ will go down 90% and up 150% on the next day.

Or if we imagine you invested $100 in each:

QQQ goes from $100 -> $70 -> $105

TQQQ goes from $100 -> $10 -> $25

As you can see, it doesn't match overall gains and the ability to recover from drops isn't linear. A 50% drop requires 100% to recover. A 100% drop requires infinity% to recover. You can't compare a 1% drop to a 1% gain in the long run. It just gets worse as you multiply the drops by bigger and bigger numbers.

Imagine for a day QQQ drops by 34%. How long to recover from the drop on TQQQ? Forever. Meanwhile QQQ recovers in less than infinite time. Plus, drops tend to be massive when they happen to something like QQQ.

Although that's just an example to show what it trends towards. Pretty sure most letfs have some sort of stop loss or restriction that activates if they drop too much in a given day. It's not likely to actually hit 0 like that.

Honestly the way I see it, long term TQQQ is what i think your performance would be if you were on margin loan and margin called yourself on every day you ended with a loss, and sold shares at the bottom from it.

I have a target allocation, and I rebalance quarterly to match my target allocation. Thus, when equities are up big, im selling and building bonds and MF. When stocks are down, im selling bonds and MF to buy stocks.

Yes, the leveraged ETG itself experiences beta slippage (not volatility decay). When returns are low or mid while vol is high, volatility decay simply means that you make less than 3x the expected return. Beta slippage also compounds upwards. When returns are mid or high and vol is low, you make *more* than 3x the expected CAGR.

leverage is not recommended unless you have a higher risk tolerance, but it can definitely be done long term. you are taking on compensated risk when you leverage. believe it or not, this is much better than concentrating your portfolio.

2. 3X leverage is probably too much in the long term, although there is a chance it could work. Not worth the risk. 1.5X to 2X is adequate for a risk tolerant investor to hold long term.


3. For the hundredth time, no you do not. The drag can work in your favor. UPRO (3X SPY) has performed close to 5X SPY from inception in some time frames. If you don't want a leveraged ETF, you can also take a margin loan, but then you'd have to pay interest, and could get margin called, which is not ideal. Something like an unpaid mortgage with very low interest qualifies as a source of good leverage.


4. Again, leverage has time diversification benefits over an investor's lifetime. Young investors with a good risk tolerance and safe future earnings are making a sensible decision when they leverage a well diversified global equity portfolio.


5. By the way, there are ways to use leverage to keep your risk constant for higher amount of return, by leveraging a stock/bond portfolio (something like RSSB).

The Smoot-Hawley act of 1930, did not cause the stock market crash of 1929, which caused 659 banks to fail. 

The Great Depression was global, not limited to the US. 

The Fordney-Mccumber Tariff act of 1922 likely contributed more to the Great Depression than smoot-hawley did, but it also led to economic growth in the US in the sevens years before that, so Reddit doesn’t like to talk about it. 

The f-m tariffs raised the average tariff rate on dutiable imports from 27% to 38.5%. The S-M tariffs raised it from 38.5% to 53%. The current tariffs will increase it from 7.4% to 17.3%.

2-Low leverage like 1.5x or 2x.

3-Long-term bull trend, even if you have a recession, if you are in the juicy decade-ish long of bull trend despite volatility and recession, you will end positive and around 2x if that is the original leverage.

In a bear market like that there will be daily headlines about the stock market being broken, never to recover. I doubt many people can hold through that, especially if it lasts years. Also, there’s always the chance that you’re forced to sell.

LETF,Investing,1hkkvtb,Question about TQQQ for long term,m3fljpb,"Problem with TQQQ - like all leveraged ETFs - is just math. Suppose for example our hypothetical underlying, $FOO, is $100, and our triple-leveraged etf, $TFOO, is also $100. Imagine one day FOO goes up 10% to $110. Then the next day it goes down 9% back to $100.10. Over the same period of time, TFOO will go up 30% to $130, then down 27% to ... $94.90.

This is an extreme example of some pretty high movement, though you could see this kind of scale in realtime with stuff like leveraged MSTR or BTC ETFs this year. The intuition on a leveraged ETF is that it has a magical price from which all movement gets compressed around, but that only baits people in. Think about a stock that goes up 1000% and then down 100%. Now imagine a 3x leveraged ETF where the underlying went up 1000%... and then down 34%. Downside movements are amplified disporportionately.

So this is why people don't recommend leveraged ETFs longterm. Stocks tend to trade pretty sideways. They meander up and down, and even if the sustained movement is up, on a leveraged ETF the downs can easily wipe out all the ups while the underlying is still going up over time. In a raging bull market like we've had this year, the green days can be so consistent that you make bank on the leverage. TQQQ is up something like 64% this year, far more than the actual QQQ. But look at the 5 year charts and you'll see the effect that this bleeding has had even right after a parabolic run up.

If you don't know what you're doing, don't park your money in TQQQ or any leveraged ETF. (And if you do know what you're doing... you don't need me to tell you that.)",1734960098.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hkkvtb/question_about_tqqq_for_long_term/m3fljpb/
LETF,Investing,1hkkvtb,Question about TQQQ for long term,m3h82u5,"TQQQ leverage resets daily, which means long term it does not track the nasdaq 3x. in some markets it even outperforms that, in others it will underperform. these products really only work when the underlying has a lot more green than red days, aggressively trends upwards and never sees larger enough drawdowns to fully wipe the fund.

imo chasing TQQQ is just overfitting historical performance. the last decade and a half has been pretty much a perfect storm for tech companies to grow aggressively and also all of the drawdowns have been aggressively Vshaped- which is historically unlikely. both harder drawdowns and slower, more prolonged drawdowns/bleeding would wreck these funds.

LETF,Investing,1h37iek,Here is a thesis for investing on a lump sum amount using S&P 500 but in different flavors,lzopa7q,"The risk of doing leveraged funds is that you need to observe what the market is doing so you can exit the ETF. You need to do this because buy and hold doesn't necessarily work with leveraged ETFs.

On rare big drops a leveraged etf drops more. A 2x etf drops to zero on 50% dip of the market, and 4x etf drops to zero with a 25% dip. When ETFs hit zero they don't recover. How many long term leveraged ETFs can you find? 

I personally feel that if you are comfortable with that kind of active participation in the market you are better off leveraging your money with low cost high strike price covered calls. You sell the covered call contract for a fee, for a sale price higher than you think it will go in a set amount of time, and if the sale goes through you earn the strike price of your stock. 

This sounds riskier but choose a company that you plan on holding forever and that even if the stock has dips you don't think will ever go bankrupt (or go soon) and your asset probably won't hit a value of zero. A leveraged etf is harder to predict due to its high number of assets and ability to fall very very quickly.

1. When researching UPRO/TQQQ, I found that they hold quite a lot of CASH and Bonds. IMO, this is protecting them from hitting 0 and a hedge against the bear market, as bonds are negatively correlated with the stock market. I still need to do more research.
2. The example of GME covered calls you gave. Does it work for non-volatile/non-WSB type stocks? Do I just extrapolate the growth potential of these stocks and play it accordingly? This might be a super n00b question. So, I apologize in advance.
3. Another concern about actively trading using short-term covered calls is the tax implications. Won't I have to pay at much higher rate, than if I just held on to an asset long enough to pay only long term gains tax. I am in a high tax bracket and in a state with state tax.

I think it was short-sighted to sell all your investments to go back to all cash. If I were you, I would've kept my good performers, dumped the poor performers, and then kept cash around to buy on the dips as they occurred. One of my investing rules is to have cash or cash equivalents on hand to buy on the dips and to never margin invest. I prefer to have 1% to 5% of my portfolio value in cash or cash equivalents available for dips in the market.

The right deal never shows itself until after it happens, and by then, you'll invest too late. Every moment you have just cash sitting around, you're losing value in that cash. Why not at least stick it in a HYSA until you feel like getting back into the market?

You can do it with a backtest tough. I tried that with a hypothetical 3xS&P500 ETF starting in 2007 once. At the bottom in march 2009, you would be down like 95%. The 3x etf would breakeven with the 1x around 2018, only to get beaten back down in 2020.

Today, after 17 years, the 3x ETF would only be ~25% higher than the regular index. Thats a lot of volatility for a pretty modest gain if you as me.

Of course, you could do better by continously buying throughout the period. But even then, 10 or even 20 years may not be enough if the market gets an extended period of poor returns.

I also started gradually. $1000 whenever my personal buy signal was triggered. I’ve put in $80k over time and the total return stands at 40% to date. I believe that compares to 15% for QQQ.

LETF,Investing,1dgrs4r,Genuine question - long term TQQQ VS QQQ,l8s854s,"> What are the disadvantages of investing in TQQQ instead of QQQ

The disadvantages are higher management fees than QQQ.

Higher volatility decay than QQQ

borrowing costs eating into the NAV

larger potential for behavioral issues from investors due to leverage

> If you’re expecting QQQ to be higher in 20 years compared to right now, doesn’t it make more sense to invest in TQQQ instead?

not necessarily, no. if you know what the standard deviation of QQQ will be over the next 20 years, what the returns of QQQ will be, and what the interest rates will average then you can determine if it would be a good deal or not. Those three items, along with the expense ratio of the funds determine your return on TQQQ. If any of those are particularly high during your investment period, you'll have poorer returns compared to, what you might expect given the leveraged ratio and even compared to the underlying fund.

I found this link from /u/modern_football on exactly this. I would encourage you to thoroughly read pretty much all of this man's threads on the topic as they are very good. I'd also encourage you to read the prospectus of the fund too and pay particular attention to the volatility vs returns table in the prospectus. 

From my own personal experience running a leveraged portfolio using TMF/TQQQ/UPRO (pretty much HEFA) I would have been better off sticking with the underlying - as I've only made 14% in total since June of 2020, in large part due to TMF but I knew that was a risk. However, this means I've lost about 34%+ in total returns as a result of using this portfolio and keeping with it compared to simply buying VOO.

In the 2. case you are also doing leveraging. However, because you are also paying off the loan, the interest affects smaller and smaller sum of money every time. Whereas the interest on your investment affects presumably bigger and bigger sum everytime. 

You can play around loan payoff calculators to see how much interest you are paying for the loan and then how much profit you could get over estimated return of said ETF.

http://ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php

There are two things one needs to make clear for himself.
1) Every financial product has a leverage which is completely arbitrary. The SPY or QQQ you regularly buy and hold also has a leverage of exactly 1. From an abstract standpoint we have to realize that leverage is something implicit in every financial product, even if it’s just 1. There are even ETFs with a leverage of 0.5. What that will do is they minimize the drawbacks of what other people criticize regarding LETFs even in comparison to the regular SPY. So e.g. a 0,5x LETF of SPY doesn’t have as much decay as the regular (1x) SPY on down-days.
BUT: You miss out on returns on the up-days. Obviously. 
What I want to say is that leverage is in every financial product and the leverage of 1x is basically arbitrary. 

2) That leads to the second point: there is no evidence that a leverage of exactly 1 is the perfect maximum risk/return leverage. It’s quite the opposite. If one thinks logical: why would a leverage of 1 be the exact, perfect r/r leverage. The link above has backtested it for SPY and QQQ.",1710052965.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1bb34i2/letfs_are_they_really_so_bad/ku6sebd/

* 3% in SPUU (2x) —  +14% since Jan 
* 2% in TQQQ (3x) — +16.5% since Jan 

However. Like others have commented, in the long term they lose out to QQQ because of inter-day volatility. LETFs can and do outperform indexes across short time frames in bull markets. Since my hypothesis is that we will have another few run ups this year, I’m staying in to capitalize on those gains. 

But it’s a short term gamble and I **HAVE** to profit-take at some point. Because it **WILL** drop below QQQ and start underperforming. If I start to feel less optimistic as an investor I’ll pull out, or if it hits equilibrium with QQQ I’ll pull out.

LETF,Investing,1aeksmt,Coupons on leveraged bond ETFs,kk90y9c,"TMF aims to provide 3x the total return of the index each individual day, before fees. Over any time period longer than one day, the return will not be 3x the return of the index. For example, if the index increases by 5% on day 1 and drops  4.76% on day 2, the index will end up back where it started. TMF would be up 15% and then down 14.28%. The net result is that TMF would be down about 1.4%, even though the index is flat. TMF would then subtract its fee on top of that. 

The yield on bonds is priced in to the futures. TMF is effectively borrowing from the short end of the yield curve and using that borrowed money to leverage up at the long term end.

LETF,Investing,196rwjl,Leveraged ETF’s am i just not understanding something?,khw69u0,"Leveraged funds are daily rebalanced, which turns into something called “slippage”, in the long term, if the fund experiences a period of losses, it can wipe out years of gains.

Example of slippage: 
Day 1: SPY @500, 1x fund @500, 3x @500
Day 2: SPY goes down 10 points, 1x fund @490, 3x @470
Day 3: SPY goes up 10 points back to Breakeven 500, 1x fund @500, 3x fund @**498.78**
The reason is because they rebalance daily so instead of their gain being based off the original 500, it’s based off their 470, cause it’s rebalanced *daily* and not *indefinitely* as it is in a regular portfolio

Over time slippage gets worse and worse, and is more extreme through higher volatility.

Okay, why don’t funds just not rebalance daily? 
1. Well, if the underlying product goes down -33% or more, the fund goes defunct (for 3x leverage) within a day this is highly unlikely, but given a long enough time frame, it’s very likely to happen eventually and it’s safe to say no bank is going to take that trade, pretty much inevitable loss
2. As your fund value strays further away from the original price, the exact amount of leverage shifts, if you don’t rebelance at all, and the underlying goes up +100%, the fund is no longer 3x leverage, it turns into 2x, so the fund would no longer be able to claim their exact leverage. When dealing with daily values, the spread is much tighter although their leverage technically does change throughout the day (98% of daily movements in the market is +/-3%, minuscule compared to long term “volatility”)",1705277795.0,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/196rwjl/leveraged_etfs_am_i_just_not_understanding/khw69u0/

LETF,Investing,196rwjl,Leveraged ETF’s am i just not understanding something?,khvp8ho,"The levered ETF returns triple the % DAILY return of the underlying index, so it won’t necessarily return 3x over a longer period of time. You also have to factor in borrowing costs which add a drag.

For example, say you hold $100 of QQQ and it drops 10% on day 1 to $90, and then rises 11% on day 2 back to $100. TQQQ will drop 30% on day 1 to $70 and then rise 33% on day 2 to $93.5. This is an example of beta decay / volatility decay. Volatile markets cause you to underperform 3x over a period of time. On the other hand smooth, upward trending markets will mean the levered ETF performs better than 3x over time. 

I do believe there can be a place for levered ETFs as part of a balanced portfolio. If you have a long enough time horizon and a strong enough stomach, a DCA strategy can outperform over time, especially very long time horizons. During the financial crisis you would have had to deal with 95%+ drawdowns from peak to trough, and it took roughly a decade to get back to where you were. For levered ETFs, timing the market beats time in the market unless we are talking about a period of 50+ years, when even lump sum levered ETFs strategies can win. 

You have to ask yourself if you really do have a strong enough stomach for it. Most people realise in bear markets that their risk tolerance is a lot lower than they expected!

E.g. the market goes up +5% and next day it goes down -5%.
That's almost the same, you don't gain and you don't lose right? Nope: with 3x leverage you lose.
Let's do some calculation: suppose it start at 100, then it does +5%, TQQQ will go up +15% at 115.
Then the market lose 5% then 105-5%=99,75.
TQQQ will lose -15% so 115-15%=97,75.
While without leverage you lose 0,25% with 3x you lose 2,25%.
This effect is even worse if it first lose then it gains, and cumulate over time.
So it's easy that in the long run you will gain without leverage and you will lose with leverage.

The rationale behind 60/40 is that stocks and bonds are inversely correlated, so when stocks are down, bonds are are up, and vice versa. So having a 60/40 split reduces volatility.

However, stocks and bonds are more often than not positively correlated. They were negatively correlated during the last 40 years of decreasing interest rates, and people assume that will continue forever. It won't. Now we're in a new regime with structural inflation because of de-globalization, demographics, EV adoption, etc. When inflation is high, stocks and bonds are positively correlated - increasing interest rates hurt stocks and bonds. For that reason, stocks and bonds no longer hedge one another and reduce volatility, so 60/40 is dead.

Of course, you can reduce volatility with short term bonds, but that's not what was used in 60/40 portfolios - they bought long term bonds.",1694809056.0,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/16jc52e/is_the_6040_portfolio_dead/k0qveo1/

LETF,Investing,15s1hyg,Who Are Your Investment Heroes?,jwc6buh,"Peter Lynch. He said, ""never buy stocks BECAUSE they're going down"". He also said, ""invest in what you know"". It's not his fault if you don't know about anything lucrative, won't stick to what you know, or can't find an investment in your area of knowledge. I've held between 3 and 6 companies since July 2020 and only sell when my fundamental thesis for the company changes or my highest conviction holding gets massively undervalued. In the latter case, I do MY OWN VALUATION and then concentrate my holdings (increasing my beta at low valuations). I don't buy anything I wouldn't be fine holding for 5-10 years. My net worth has more than doubled in the last 18 months and none of my holdings are at all-time highs; I haven't sold a share.

The part of your argument against buying individual stocks that's based on professional managers/pickers ignores a huge factor: their number one priority is not always what you seem to assume it is. There's a huge psychological game they have to be aware of and play because their rich customers get some kind of way when they actually experience volatility, which means they have to limit risk to an extreme degree, which means the upside to their strategy...

I'm definitely not saying it's easy, but it's doable if you're lucky enough to have really specific knowledge of technologies/businesses that are lucrative.

Lastly, I also listen to Warren Buffet when it comes to investment philosophy (but not specific investments- we have different goals).

The expected returns of a leveraged ETF like SSO are not ""2x the S&P 500 minus some drag"" - over the long term the two assets appear to have almost nothing to do with each other, unless you pick apart the stochastic differential equation which governs their relationship. Here's the abstract from the paper above, if it helps:

> It is well known that leveraged exchange-traded funds (LETFs) do not reproduce the corresponding multiple of index returns over extended (quarterly or annual) investment horizons. For instance, in 2008 and early 2009, most LETFs underperformed the corresponding static strategies. In this paper, we study this phenomenon in detail. We give an exact formula linking the return of a leveraged fund with the corresponding multiple of the return of the unleveraged fund and its realized variance. This formula is tested empirically over quarterly horizons for 56 leveraged funds (44 double-leveraged and 12 triple-leveraged) using daily prices since January 2008 or since inception, according to the fund considered. The results indicate excellent agreement between the formula and the empirical data. The study also shows that leveraged funds can be used to replicate the returns of the underlying index, provided we use a dynamic rebalancing strategy. Empirically, we find that rebalancing frequencies required to achieve this goal are moderate—on the order of one week between rebalancings. Nevertheless, this need for dynamic rebalancing leads to the conclusion that LETFs as currently designed may be unsuitable for buy-and-hold investors.",1692037755.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15qiphh/voo_vs_sso_which_one_is_good_for_long_term/jw6a7vv/

> The computation is based on historical data. Obviously nobody knows what the future holds.

No, the Kelly criterion is a theoretical tool for sizing bets given a model which predicts expected returns - from the first paragraph of the Wikipedia page, ""It assumes that the expected returns are known and is optimal for a bettor who values their wealth logarithmically."" Often we are forced to set our return expectations based on historical data, but in the case of leveraged ETFs we can directly model the (probabilistic) relationship between the returns of the ETF and the returns of the underlying index because we know how the ETF is managed.

> Your paper disagrees:

> ""Formula (10) suggests that an investor who is long an LETF has a “time-decay” associated with the realized variance of the underlying ETF.""

If the variance of the underlying was the only term in the formula for expected returns, and if expected returns depended sub-exponentially on that variance, then it would match the naive model that you proposed! Unfortunately, neither of these statements are true.

> Obviously the time horizon isn't in the next 1000 years. For most people they'll probably looking at a few decades. It completely depends on how large the tracking error is within that timeframe.

You stopped reading right before I said ""but"". The part after ""but"" is the important bit.

> But it is true? The formula has components for accumulated variance, plus borrowing cost & management fees which are obvious factors that most people don't need explicitly mentioned.

The key point is that the expected return function is not a straightforward ""linear plus error term"" function of these factors - the factors appear in the coefficients of a highly nonlinear stochastic equation whose solution is the expected return function. If you want to know how those terms contribute to the magnitude of the difference between the leveraged ETF and its index then you have to do some serious mathematics - it's not enough to just shit answers out of your head.

>  On a scale of decades, the tracking error would need to be thousands or tens of thousands times more than that.

You can expect significantly higher returns during bull runs as TQQQ compounds 3x daily on itself. QQQ is up about 950% since 2010 and TQQQ is up 10000%.

LETF,Investing,1542yq1,Investing into leveraged portfolio,jsoj6h7,"100% VOO does massively outperform 60% VT and 40% BND since 2009.

It's just really hard to beat the returns on the S&P in any kind of risk adjusted way.  Almost anything you do will kill returns without meaningfully impacting your max drawdown.

If you notice, nobody is doing AWP because of the high returns that come along with it.  Default ""real"" AWP is gaining less than 5% a year on average.  It's just not a high return strategy.

Leveraging it at like 1.8x will return more in line with long term S&P returns and it ""should"" be lower drawdowns at the same time, but it's definitely the case that in recent years the correlation of everything is getting much closer to 1 than in prior eras.

The benefits of diversifying across asset classes have been going down for a long time, and the benefits of deviating from 100% VOO have been going down with it.

The difference between 100% UPRO vs 90% UPRO 10% CASHX is almost nothing in max drawdown, but it's a huge drag on returns.

Putting the 10% in BND is not meaningfully better.  Putting any money in BND actually makes your max drawdown worse than just having the same amount in VOO.

REITs are more like stocks than they are like RE, so you can't even buy an REIT fund to pretend like you are diversifying into RE.

Putting money in GLD increases your max drawdown.  TLT increases your max drawdown.

I halfway want to say that diversifying across asset classes is dead.

If it's not clear, I have spent a lot of time backtesting this kind of thing in my life.  It's kinda nice to see a new person interested in Leveraged AWP, even if it's not much of a thing anymore from my perspective.

Anything that had any kind of advantage going into 2022 subsequently lost that advantage in 2022.

The unleveraged AWP suggested 30% VTI, 40% VGLT, 15% SCHR, 8% GLDM, 7% BCI in the article has much worse returns and the difference in max drawdown is negligible between that and 100% VOO.  Leveraging it up until it has the same max drawdown as 100% VOO still leaves you with lower returns than 100% VOO has.

This is a really big problem for Leveraged AWP strategies.

In a theoretical sense, changing the above to 10% UPRO, 50% VGLT, 20% SCHR, 10% GLDM, 10% BCI should work to improve returns, but it doesn't.  Instead, it increases drawdowns and decreases returns.

This is not how things are supposed to work.  Leveraging the stock side so you can fit in more stuff like bonds is supposed to put you in a better place on the efficient frontier, but it doesn't.

Bonds are at the heart of Leveraged AWP strategies and the increasing interest rates of late have absolutely killed their performance as an asset class.",1689822436.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1542yq1/investing_into_leveraged_portfolio/jsoj6h7/

2 The micro yield futures, unlike the underlying notes or the regular treasury note futures, rise with rising yields, so if you want to profit from a drop in yields, you need to sell it, not buy it.  

3 One micro 2yr yield futures contract will rise $10 for each basis point change in yield, so $2000 for +200 bps rise. In order for that amount to be a 50% gain for you, you would need to have an account size of $4000. If your account size is $25k (which was the minimum account size TDA asked me when I opened a futures account, other brokers may require less), you would sell six or seven contracts to get a proportionally equivalent position.",1685205356.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/13s8yr9/etf_for_short_term_treasury_yields/jlu88mx/

LETF,Investing,123tz8q,Are there leveraged ETFs that are safe to hold long-term?,jdwxo46,"Short answer, avoid holding leveraged etfs. 

Long answer, the decay thing you’re asking about can be seen in this example:

Let’s say the 
Underlying etf starts at $100 
3x leveraged etf starts at $100

The underlying asset as a $5 gain in the market 
Meaning it had a 5% gain 

Therefore the leveraged etf would have a 15% gain 

Leaving the underlying etf at $105 and the leveraged etf at $115. The problem is they don’t always go up. 

So let’s say shortly after this, the etf drops back to $100. That would be a 4.76% drop. 

The leveraged etf would then drop 14.28% (4.76% x 3)
14.28% x 115 = 16.422

115-16.422= 98.578

Which lowers its value to $98.578


So the underlying eft is the exact same price, but due to how the leverage works on the downside, the leveraged etf is worth less.

LETF,Investing,123tz8q,Are there leveraged ETFs that are safe to hold long-term?,jdyplw6,">So leveraged losses are more than leveraged gains, essentially.

No. The leverage is constant. The only thing the parent comment is demonstrating is that geometric returns are smaller than arithmetic returns, and you don't need to mention leverage once to notice the effect.

A more straightforward example: the arithmetic average of a 10% gain and a 10% loss is 0%, but because returns compound, the realized return is 1.1\*0.9-1 = -1% (note that this is exactly -10% of 10%). Same thing but with 5% and -5%, average is 0% but realized return is 1.05\*0.95-1 = -0.25% (note that this is exactly -5% of 5%). The difference between the arithmetic average return and the realized geometric return will always be the interaction effect in these cases (the product of the two returns). With more than 2 data points, you can approximate the difference as half the variance of the returns. The geometric average return is *always* less than the arithmetic average return except when all the returns are identical (0 variance), in which case they're equal. This is true of any set of numbers no matter what they represent (leverage is irrelevant). A potentially useful observation is that when you multiply a series by a constant (for example, 3x leverage), the variance of the series is multiplied by the square of the constant. So a 3x leveraged fund will have a difference between its arithmetic and geometric returns that is 9x larger than the difference of the unleveraged series. Similarly, a 0.5x leveraged fund (i.e., 50% cash and 50% equity) will have a difference between its arithmetic and geometric returns that is 1/4 of the 100% equity fund. Whether the leverage ""pays off"" and ultimately produces a higher return than the underlying is a function of the size of the arithmetic return (higher average return -> leverage is great) and the variance (higher variance for the same arithmetic average return -> leverage gets worse).

The arithmetic average of the leveraged series is simply leverage times the arithmetic average of the unleveraged series (minus the interest cost due to borrowing). The geometric return will then be half of the variance less than that number. At a certain point, because the variance is leverage squared and the leverage increases arithmetic return linearly, there will be a critical point where leverage leads to underperformance. The trick is figuring out what level of leverage that is and staying below it, which is only possible if you can predict future volatility.",1679975649.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/123tz8q/are_there_leveraged_etfs_that_are_safe_to_hold/jdyplw6/

I can't have M1 finance here, but luckily, there is only 1 tax rate, and no short/long distinction. I'm glad that it's something people smarter than me are having to resort to modeling with broker software instead of me overlooking something simple.

> One thing that strikes me in simulating under that scenario is that with an active multi-asset approach the tax drag seems to go down as the leverage goes up. This is counter to intuition, so take with a grain of salt.

Wow, that certainly is most unexpected. Surely this has to depend on the number of holdings though, because with with just 2 holdings, it's easy to imagine one getting wiped out while the other rallies, and while cancelling taxes on gains is good, it has to be better to avoid the losses in the first place or there would be an incentive to lose, right?

> Of course, this won't work unless losses can be carried over from year to year.

Yes sorry, I should have clarified we can carry losses over here too.

> The other thing with an active strategy is that much of the final portfolio is ""young,"" so the assets have not appreciated much. It would be interesting to see if that holds for your country.

That's probably going to be a key difference between our approaches, in that I likely won't have a young portfolio because of greater emphasis on lowering turnover.

Another thing that came to mind is that with more assets, I can probably use my contributions to rebalance things for longer, as the smaller individual holdings will require less inflow after getting destroyed.",1678735782.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/11q58p7/calculating_the_expected_annual_tax_drag_of_a/jc3fq0v/

LETF,Investing,109xin3,Are there downsides to leveraged index ETFs if you have a long time horizon?,j42i6mf,"If leverage is moderate (1.2-1.5x) you can increase the expected compound return over the long term. 

There's a concept known as the Kelly Criteria that suggests there's an optimal leverage that maximizes expected compound return. Increasing leverage to match the Kelly limit, theoretically gives maximum expected return. Beyond the Kelly limit the expected compound growth rate drops and risk of ruin (100% loss) rises very quickly. The stock market doesn't have guaranteed risk/reward characteristics so it's not a good idea to leverage up to full Kelly based on historical market data. I suspect 3x leverage has a high likelihood of total loss. 

There are two other issues to consider that are more critical than evaluating the optimal leverage. First, is whether you can tolerate the volatility of a leveraged portfolio. Most people freak out when the market drops more than 20%. That would be a very regular occurrence with a leveraged portfolio. 

Second, even though you might fully accept the possibility of sticking to your leveraged strategy through a very deep drawdown, your leveraged ETF fund may not survive it. An extreme drawdown can trigger fund closure and you will have your assets sold off at the worst possible price. Then you will have to seek alternative methods of obtaining leverage to recover.

today NQh3 requires about 17380 (call it 18k) of margin for 1 contract (worth 221k) or about 8% margin.  so if you were to look back 10 years ago the backadjusted NQ1 price is about 1611, and that 8% margin (i know margin rates change over time, its a back of envelope estimate here) means youd need about 2500 to buy 1 contract.

so 10y ago if you bought 2500 of TQQQ you would have a 14.93% return.  if you purchased 3 lots of NQ1 futures and just rolled them quarterly, your return is about 17.58%. the delta in that (\~26bps / year is the dead weight loss of a daily % resetting vehicle vs a quarterly resetting vehicle)

because I understand how leverage functions. 

to quote *Market Sense and Nonsense* by Jack Schwager: 

>The failure of investors to understand the negative consequences of volatility on return can lead to unpleasant surprises. A good example of this phenomenon is the experience of many investors who buy leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs). **Typically, investors who buy a leveraged (2×) ETF expect to earn twice the amount as in the corresponding unleveraged ETF if the market advances. Over any extended period of time, however, they typically find the return is less than twice the amount if the market advances and the loss more than twice the amount if the market declines. Analogous comments would apply to leveraged short ETFs—that is, the gains on market declines will tend to be less than twice the market decline and the losses on price advances will tend to be more than twice the price rise.**

I agree with this. a beta of 3 is ridiculous, it's way too much risk for most people, unless you just want to put in a small amount of play money.

>Another thing to keep in mind is that a 3X leveraged ETF (let's say TQQQ) resets its leverage daily.

Yes, that's how they work. And for some reason every investing article makes it seem like the daily resetting is going to completely destroy their performance and make them useless. But under most conditions it's not that far off from just matching 3x the market (minus the leverage cost and management fees of course). Daily resetting isn't necessarily bad- compared to having a fixed margin loan the resetting helps in trending markets and hurts in flat/choppy markets. 

Anyway I just think it's funny that all the investing articles warn so strongly about the wrong thing. It's like telling someone not to buy a racecar that goes 300 MPH for normal driving because ""OMG you'll have to spend extra for premium gasoline!""

With the Fed rates increase upon the banks, those same banks now shift those costs to the consumer, via increasing the rates on loans. And that includes mortgages. So it makes it more challenging to service adjustable loans, and take up new ones (Kudos to those that took a fixed rate). That may also lead to less buyers, and more sellers.

But the short version is that if you bought before a crash like 2008, you might still be down today, or at least would be down over a long period of time. Backtests of these ETFs are very sensitive to when you enter/exit them. Move your test one year and suddenly you're under-performing SPY.

This is why there's a more complicated approach - the 'hedgefundie' approach (named after a commenter who helped spur discussion) uses UPRO and a leveraged bond fund. This gets you some better protection. But it still has some big risks (the hedging approach didn't work this year, for example).",1660661179.0,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/wpvplv/why_are_leveraged_etfs_like_upro_discouraged_for/ikiwzgg/

LETF,Investing,wpvplv,"Why are leveraged ETFs like UPRO discouraged for long term holding, when just looking at ""what if I bought $1000 in year X"" pretty consistently shows a 3x return over S&P over those years?",ikkmr0h,"Preface: I’m long SSO (2x daily S&P 500). I effectively lumped in by reallocating my Roth IRA to 60% VOO, 40% SSO around early March, and have also experienced it with some DCA via my brokerage account, allowing me to have both experiences at once. 

Everybody wants to hold LETFs long term, until it’s time to hold LETFs long term. 

As with seemingly every aspect of equity investing, people tend to fixate on the sexy part— allocation. What they tend to ignore is that behaviors and psychology can be success killers. 

At one point this year, the SSO position in my Roth IRA was -30%. The market has been trending very steadily down, with the S&P 500 having… I think it was 5 straight red weeks at one point? Everything you hear about LETFs is “vol decay! Don’t hold when consistently down or sideways!” Again, that -30% position made up about 40% of my Roth IRA, and contribution cap meant I couldn’t DCA. 

Main point: the reality every day for months was waking up to a significant position going deeper into the red, faster than the index, knowing that this is specifically the worst set of market conditions for holding these assets. 

People were panic selling out of unlevered accounts and positions every day. Market news was doom and gloom. 

That’s uncomfortable, and my positions are only 2x, not 3x like UPRO, or 3x equities AND bonds as both sides crashed, like HFEA. For all I knew, the market could continue going down for another year or more. 

The question we all need to answer before we allow ourselves to find that circumstance is, “how realistic is it for me as an individual to hold through that type of extended down cycle? How will I feel about that?” Everybody wants to believe they’ll hold. The LETF sub pretty well dried up, so a lot of people seemed to feel less enthusiastic when things got real. 

Main point: you need to understand you, before you get into these. 

Frankly, I went 1.4x without a bond hedge because I took the time to learn about drag, circumstances which could bury both sides of hedged strategies at once, etc. I spent time doing nightmare scenario backtests. While doing so, I quickly realized that I wanted no part of relying on a hedge, or holding 3x leveraged equities. For me, the velocity of downturns in 3x is not agreeable. 

However, I was very comfortable and confident with 2x as part of an overall 1.4x, unhedged strategy. 

That careful consideration is why I’ve been able to hold. 

As I type this, that SSO position in my Roth IRA is still -8.66%, and there is a lot of talk of a reversal of the rally, and deeper lows to follow. Because I set the position on the way down, it has never been green. 

That’s OK for me. It may be OK for you. Maybe it wouldn’t be. You need to sort that out before you consider committing to these. 

Best of luck in your journey! I hope this has been helpful.",1660684565.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/wpvplv/why_are_leveraged_etfs_like_upro_discouraged_for/ikkmr0h/

Leverage exists in private markets (e.g. private equity firms almost always lever their investments) as well and many of the S&P500 constituents have debt (i.e. leverage) on their balance sheets to begin with. 

When leverage results in higher returns is super simple: if the cost of debt is lower than the unlevered return, then the levered return will be higher than the unlevered. Given that borrowing costs should in theory be lower than equity returns, a levered ETF in the long run should always outperform the unlevered (assuming reasonably low mgmt fees).

Still, most retail investors should avoid levered ETFs. Let's say that after analysing your personal risk tolerance you have determined that you can hold 50% of your wealth in the S&P500, and the remainder in cash. A 2x levered S&P500 would have double the volatility, so for the same risk tolerance, you should hold only 25% of your wealth in a 2x levered S&P500 ETF. 25% of your wealth in 2x levered S&P500 will produce a slightly lower return than 50% of wealth in the unlevered S&P500 due to borrowing costs, so you would be worse off.",1660680615.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/wpvplv/why_are_leveraged_etfs_like_upro_discouraged_for/ikkcrzu/

By the time you recover you will hit another drawdown and your PnL will asymptotically approach zero as a function of time and volatility. This is not as problematic if you have 10-20% leverage (it’s recoverable, but beyond a certain level of vol your odds of making money in the long run converge towards 0). In fact if you have a long horizon and are 100% invested in equities it would be a good strategy to deploy 10-20% leverage to magnify the returns over time. The practical problem is that after costs of implementing such leverage it doesn’t make a lot of sense (financing costs).",1660744147.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/wpvplv/why_are_leveraged_etfs_like_upro_discouraged_for/iknmqcc/

It depends on your perspective. If you assume the movements are distributed around 0%, then you get what you say above. If you assume that the stock is distributed around some average price because it has some fundamental value underlying the price, then the upward movements would be a bit larger than the downward movements such that a 1x multiplier would on average stay the same amount but 2x and 3x would still lose value to that effect.

Daily leverage creates this path dependency with vol decay. However, if you leveraged a portfolio with floating leverage (2x on day 1, but goes up and down based on how the market is doing) this leverage decay is a lot less. i.e. you will be able to just 2x the return of SPY minus interest, without worrying about the path dependency.

I’m gonna pull some numbers out of my ass because I’m tired but let’s say that stocks crash 10%. If they rise 10% after that, you’re still in the red. You need them to rise 11-12% to be back to break even. You also need them to make that 11-12% rise -without- dropping again. If they rise 5% and then crash 10% again, you’re not looking for a 15% rise (0 - 10 + 5 -10) to get back to break even, you’re looking for closer to 20% to get back to break even because you’re still trying to recover the original crash + the second crash. 

Stocks do tend to rise, on average, over the long term. Yes. However because the downside hurts you more than the upside helps you, all those down days results in death by a thousand cuts as you very slowly bleed money from all the down days. 

Also remember that you’re very much over-exposed to the “black swan” days where the markets tank. A 10% drop in S&P is a 30% drop for you, and there won’t be a single day 10% rise back up, it’ll be very slow chipping away at the red rises. The worst day in modern US stock market history, from a brief search I just did, was March 9, 2020, where the S&P closed down just under 10%. These events can and do happen.

Say a stock is at $100, you buy $300 worth (three shares) with leverage. Say your equity is $100 with $200 margin. Let’s ignore borrowing costs for sake of discussion

Stock goes down to $90 (-10%), your position goes down to $270, equity down to $70

Stock goes back to $100 (+11%), your position goes back to $300, equity back to $100

I pulled the data for TMF, TLT, and SHY (used to estimate the financing cost for the leverage). 3X TLT minus 2X SHY (~cost of leverage) minus about 1% per year for the difference in expense ratio is a pretty close match to TMF daily returns from 4/15/2009 to 7/15/2022. It almost exactly matches TMF volatility and max drawdown. TMF does have lower compound return than estimated from TLT and SHY though so there is some extra cost drag that I would want to understand better before putting money into it.

LETF,Investing,vcgksh,Portfolio Example with a Leveraged ETF,icfmfte,"Have a look a r/letfs

Overall what you're proposing is a sensible strategy, but for someone with and above average risk appetite.

To be honest leveraged etfs are poorly understood and a lot of investors throw terms around likely volatility decay without understanding it.  I suggest not trusting any advice unless it's backed ip with evidence or logic.

From my perspective the major risks of LETFs are

- the leverage.  It sounds obvious but a 3x turns a bad Monday on qqq of c4.5% down to a 13.5p% down.  If you held a 100% letf portfolio in a dot com/gfc style bear market then you will likely go from 100% to 2-10% on a 3x spy/qqq.  It's the leverage that does most of the pain here.

- the need for active mgmt and therefore good judgement and emotional control.  To be fair doing what you propose as a 90 spy 10% upro gives a 1.2 leverage and as long as you rebalanced every quarter then you could run this passively/rules based.

- volatility decay.  Firstly let me explain what it is.  It is just the effect of compounding return, let's use a few examples.

In a flat market the difference when an asset increases by x and then decrease by x ( or vice versa).  This can be written mathematically as final price = (1+x)(1-×) and simplifies to (1-x^2).  So you can see you lose x^2.  This happens with all assets, it's just mathematical fact.  But uou can see that the more volatile x is the your squaring the loss.  This is why you want to holder lower volatility assets where possible.  Now if you substitute a 3x letf in you get (1-(3x)^2) or simplified (1-9x^2).  So a 3x letf has 9x the volatility decay loss of a 1x etf in s flat market.  The important thing is that in most indices x is small as they are less volatile.  So a 1% daily up and then down leaves you with 99.99% left on spy.  On upro it leaves you with 99.91%.  It's really not that big a deal unless markets are highly volatile like now where x gets bigger.

Now let's look at up markets and down markets 

Up markets for 2 days is (1+x)^2 and down markets it's (1-x)^2.  For a 3x fund its then (1+3x)^2 and (1-3x)^2.

So if spy goes up by 1% 2 days in a row you get 102.01% or if it goes down then it's 98.01%.

For 3x funds it becomes a 106.09% and 94.09%.

So the conclusion is that the leverage is really the driver of risk and returns.  Volatility decay is a small impact and is actually beneficial in an up market (adds to the leverage impact) and beneficial in a down market (mitigates the leverage drawdown).  In a flat market it has an adverse impact, again this is minimal in all but the most volatile market (e.g. proper crashes where you see 5% daily swings)",1655283034.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/vcgksh/portfolio_example_with_a_leveraged_etf/icfmfte/

 LTFs are designed to double or triple daily movements in the market and work differently from long term ETFs.  However, I have a possible work around for you.  Open a margin account to obtain 1.2 (or whatever) exposure on IVV or VOO.  You will save on expense ratio of around 0.03 vs 0.91.  Of course, you will incur margin interest.  Use IBKR Pro for around 2.33% margin interest or M1 which is similarly low.  Dividends will nearly offset the margin interest.  All this being said, with the market down around 20% from its all time high, there may come a point where use of LTFs may make sense so long as you can weather the volatility.

It is just more return for more risk- that’s all. No one said a free lunch. Don’t strawman me. Going from 1.0X to 1.5X leverage increases systematic risk and return. That isn’t a free lunch anymore than going from 50% stocks to 100% stocks increases returns.

4. If you have legitimate arguments 2X leverage does not result in higher ending balance, I would love to have a good faith debate on the subject.

LETF,Investing,v1dkf6,Is there something I'm missing? Leverage ETFs seem great.,iaooshi,"CAPM is expected return and rarely matches the reality. Its just a theoretical model. Also anybody that knows the theory doesnt even use CAPM anymore, but the five factor model. LETF isnt simply increasing beta on the proportion of leverage, because theres a implementation problem brought by the rebalancing at the end of every day.

Backtests are fine, the problem is people blindly believing that whatever they found in it will happen again in the future. Your strategy must be based on strong investment fundamentals, whatever variables were present in the past might not be in the future. There are many statistical limitations with backtests, they work better as a diagnostic tool for a past period than as a predictive tool for the future.

Also UPRO starts on 2007 and 2010 for 2x and 3x, whatever youre backtesting is not the product youre investing. Google up ""tracking error"". On the long term, these products are not the same as being levered 2x/3x on S&P.

Again, CAPM dont hold up empirically. Theres always difference between expected and actual returns. Also theyre not an ""argument leverage can increase returns"" when talking about presently available LETFs. Yes, levering an asset that have higher returns than the rate of borrowing obviously would lead to higher returns than the underlying assets, you dont even need to backtest for that. The problem is LETFs have an implementation problem to deliver exactly that.

The sarcasm is based on whenever someone is trying to convince others that their strategy is a winner thats because they dont know what theyre doing and are too excited about a subject that is new to them.",1654017968.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/v1dkf6/is_there_something_im_missing_leverage_etfs_seem/iaooshi/

* your fixed income allocation is far too high for your age (and assume risk tolerance)
* developed markets return terribly, and essentially this is just a USD inflow/outflow bet, if you believe USD will get stronger as our relative interest rate differential grows, developed markets will fall (in both real and USD terms) so probably not a good idea.
* when you add in the other indices, you need to consider the true allocation to mid/small/large cap, you already have exposure via SPY/UPRO.  you want to determine your total desired allocation to mid/small/large cap, and achieve the desired end goal of allocations, which only you can know.

for what its worth, you're probably better off if this is a set it and forget it rebalance 1/year basket of what you originally started with, but i would bring your overall fixed income exposure down, your spx (large cap tech these days) exposure down, and round it out with some russell 2k (IWM). something like 20% IWM, 10% TLT, 50% SPY and 20% DXSLX (direxion 2x monthly resetting spx exposure)

LETF,Investing,rx24zy,Thoughts on Asset Allocation,hrfpw42,"First, as you know (or should know from studying in finance) is that just because an asset class is up recent doesn't mean anything.  If anything RTM (reversion to mean) is more likely then not so the super star asset class will eventually come back to earth and the loser last several years will eventually bounce back so both are on their expected long term returns.  When?  Who knows and that is why we diversify on a static approach vs. tactile/ dynamic.

Now that being said, one has to always ask WHY you want to add international?  Mr. Seigel in his excellent book ""Stock for the long run"" gives 2 reasons:  1.  Diversification and 2.  Currency hedging against the dollar.  If you are going to do it with international equity I don't think large cap developed market is the way to go.  Ever since the Euro solidified Europe (major country  players in those indexes) the diversification and currency hedging benefits have waned.  Pick something international small or emerging markets instead.

Now another option is to forgo international complete and get your diversification and currency hedging from adding gold.  Gold has a lower correlation to U.S. equity markets and U.S. dollar then adding international equities.  

Also, I think your leverage to stocks is more then 115%, no?  >3/4 of stocks is 3x and <1/4 is 1x that would make leverage >1.15x, no?  If that is true then you will want more leverage in your treasuries otherwise the mismatch of volatilities will be extreme and MAGNIFIED as your weighted average to stocks is much more then to the other components in the portfolio.

Maybe an option would be something like:  40%UPRO, 20%SPY, 20% leverage treasuries, 20% 2x gold?

Also, there is nothing particularly creative about what I said.  People have been doing similar optimizations for decades.  I agree that it should be viewed with suspicion if somebody actually has a creative idea, but I wouldn't particularly call this idea creative.

In this instance, I expect that the financial product will work as expected and deliver roughly 2x both the up and the down performance of the underlying.  In context, that would lead to a -60% decline in that piece of the pie with a 30% decline in S&P (unleveraged) or a -75% decline in that piece of the pie with a 30% decline in S&P (1.25x leveraged).

The max drawdown that the simulator shows for unleveraged is about 11% rounded up and 1.25x that figure is about 14%.  That follows from that piece going down by 75% and bonds going up while equities go down.

If greater long term returns are due to increased risk, then this 1.25x leveraged version should be better than the 1x version ASSUMING that we don't do something stupid during a market decline.  Since the 1.25x leveraged version would still decline by half compared to what 100% SPY declines by itself, it shouldn't be harder to maintain one's position with my suggested mix, even levered up, as compared to just holding 100% SPY.

But none of those optimizations have achieved widespread acceptance, have they? Every time I see a post like this, or something talking about the Hedgefundie approach, it always seems to present the research as fairly new even if it's built on older ideas.

The basic question you always have to ask is this: if this really is a way to get the same gains with less volatility, where is this free lunch coming from? If this is so surefire a way to save for retirement, why is it not the standard? Why do target date funds not use this, for example?

If I buy a Vanguard Target Date 2060 fund, I am not getting any leveraged bets as part of that. Why?

I am not going to say you are completely wrong, but I don't believe that it is a meaningful factor in long term LETF performance.

None of the optimizations have achieved widespread acceptance \_among retail\_.  I would agree with that statement.  Hedge funds, insurers, pension funds, college endowments, and stuff like that have been using similar math to what I am describing when making choices about asset allocation.

In case you don't believe this, consider how quickly the bigger players added CDOs to their portfolio in the 2000s.  Their AA models told them to add massively as soon as the products became available and their (at the time) risk/reward levels were ""known"".

RE ""Where are the gains coming from?"", I would posit ""diversification"" as the answer.  People typically accept that diversification has the potential to both increase returns and to reduce risk.  What I am suggesting is a simple diversification across asset classes.

Target date funds are following a different (specified) investment methodology.

Target date funds don't have a mandate to track the S&P returns with reduced volatility, and, therefore, they don't.

Target date funds follow a simple model similar to ""100 - age % in bonds, the rest in stocks"" which is another methodology that has been around and followed for decades, and regularly by retail.

It's not the first time I've seen backtests done on a strategy that rotates based on a break/breach of the 200 SMA. The last one I read was a nonleveraged strategy, but one that rotates in and out of the SPY based on whether the closing price in the last day of the month was higher or lower than the 200 SMA (to reduce seesaws). That, too, has been shown to outperform a buy&hold for the periods tested. 

The last table in this paper is a bit anticlimactic though, as is the case usually with strategies that are publicised. They usually become public when they don't work as well as they used to anymore. The table shows that if you take a more recent period (2009-2020) rather than going all the way back to 1928, both the *SSO 200-d LRS* and the *UPRO 200-d LRS* have lower Sharpe/Sortino Ratios, higher drawdowns, higher volatilities and higher Betas than a buy&hold of the SP500 during the same period. In other words, the returns if you take a more recent (and arguably a more representative) period, came at the expense of assuming greater risk.

Well guess what, those people are idiots. The reason this works is because of the lack of volatility above the 200 MA, and higher volatility below the 200 MA.

I like leveraged ETFs but I'm going to push back on this. Leveraged ETF decay is real and does exist and saying those people are idiots just shows a lack of understanding of these complex instruments. The reason shown in the paper why you should sell when below the 200 MA is that with enough volatility, leveraged decay is in fact real and very very high, otherwise why even sell below the 200 MA? The paper also only used the leveraged S&P500, backtesting SSO and UPRO. Other leveraged ETFs that follow more volatile indices such as oil or biotech or semiconductors, might have a completely different result because of the higher volatility. So this backtest of SSO and UPRO looks pretty good, but you don't want to ignore things like leveraged decay in an analysis of leveraged ETFs and even more so for other non-S&P500 ETFs.",1637538319.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qz07zp/how_to_3x_the_sp_cagr_with_less_risk_leverage_for/hlkoift/

Now that cheap and accessible leverage is available, and faster executions and lower commissions are available, to the lay investor, strategies that outperformed using these variables before would now get squeezed out (because if you think about it: if everyone starts to lever above the 200 SMA and unlever below the 200 SMA, it will stop providing better returns with the same or lower risk.)

Regarding the second point, yes, people have different tolerances and different abilities to take risk. While the table shows that the LRS strategy had lower volatility and drawdown than just holding UPRO, it also had lower total returns and Sharpe Ratio.

May I suggest a slightly less risky option? If you've not held a 3x ETF before I suggest taking a quarter or two with a 2x ETF - try $SPUU - 

It's your brokerage account, use it to learn and have some fun. 
Definitely don't put in any money you aren't willing to use. A 3x fund could get wiped out in a -33% day but it's hard to see that occuring without a massive shock given the circuit breakers now-a-days. For a 2x fund thats around 50%

I also suggest journaling your returns daily so you can see how its moving compared to the underlying.

""Levered ETFs (SSO) gives you 3x the daily results of the S&P 500. If you look at the 10-15+ year time horizon of SSO you would have drastically outperformed VOO/VTI""

  
""This leveraged ProShares ETF seeks a return that is 2x the return of its underlying benchmark (target) for a single day, as measured from one NAV calculation to the next. Due to the compounding of daily returns, holding periods of greater than one day can result in returns that are significantly different than the target return and ProShares' returns over periods other than one day will likely differ in amount and possibly direction from the target return for the same period. These effects may be more pronounced in funds with larger or inverse multiples and in funds with volatile benchmarks. Investors should monitor their holdings as frequently as daily. Investors should consult the prospectus for further details on the calculation of the returns and the risks associated with investing in this product.""",1633929650.0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q5jsdf/if_youre_young_and_have_a_very_long_investment/hg72wzx/
LETF,Investing,q5jsdf,"If you're young and have a very long investment horizon, then investing in stocks using leverage DECREASES your risk",hg9i4nv,"Thanks for sharing, OP. This has really sparked my interest.

When the pandemic arrived last year I wanted to get as much money as possible into the market that March, so in addition to taking some out of savings to invest, I wrote myself a $10,000balance transfer check against one of my credit cards with a 0% for 18 months deal with 3% up front fee and put it all into the stock market. It's more than doubled in value since then.

I will say, importantly, the entire time I carried the balance I had enough money in my savings account to fund 3+ months of my living expenses AND pay off the entire balance, and I had enough surplus in my budget to cover the minimum payment every month without hardship, so my risk was very limited. I paid the remaining balance off the month before the 0% promo would have expired.

I'm sure a lot of people would be horrified just at the notion of borrowing money on a credit card to invest it so I don't share the story much, but there's a big difference between borrowing money you don't have, and borrowing money you do have. I figured, why invest my own cash when I could invest the bank's cash and keep mine in my savings account?",1633979812.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q5jsdf/if_youre_young_and_have_a_very_long_investment/hg9i4nv/

Operative words there - CAN be. But there's a reason that Vanguard, for example, doesn't let their IRAs (or anything else if I understand correctly) invest in leveraged ETFs. There is significant, substantial risk. Some people, who understand it, should be allowed to utilize it if they are willing to stomach that risk.

""I just did a quick model and if something like UPRO/SSO had existed when I first got a good job that let me save some money in 1991, my \~$500/month taxable savings that I did then (modeled as $25 savings per trading day) would have produced a million dollar portfolio by mid-1999, even with no increase in savings/month as my pay rose. That's compared to the \~150k for straight S&P (closer to but still better than my real result, because I included bonds and had a couple hiccups in the savings flow when I bought a house/got married).  
Obviously, I would have jumped off the 3x leverage train well before that, probably at 100k or 250k for round numbers. so I wouldn't have seen that million in the 90s unless I truly forgot about my risk. If I had ridden the whole thing out, I'd have had some periods of major uncertainty. the 3x all-in portfolio actually rides out the dotcom crash/bear without dropping below S&P, but it does run all the way back down to 140k in march of 2003 from over a million 3 years earlier -- at that point only about 35% ahead of the 100% S&P. and then in april of 2009, at the bottom, it touches 54k, less than half of what's in the S&P version on 3/1/2009. It then takes until fall of 2010 to get back ahead of straight S&P for good, ending today with close to 10x what's in the S&P version.  
another version of the same idea (saving $25 per trading day) starting at the top of the market in 2000, looks.worse. It drops to about 1/2 the equivalent S&P portfolio by march of 2003, recover to nearly double by 2007, and then sinks to a mere 20% of the S&P equivalent in march of 09, taking until spring of 2013 to get back ahead -- again for good, ending with 5.5x the S&P version today at 2.8mil. vs. 510k. On the one hand, looking just at the whole run of 21 years, it's far better. OTOH, the goal is to retire early, not amass the most $, and it doesn't really start running away from the S&P until 2015 or so, when you've had a substantial amount invested for quite a while.""

A few notes -

*I'm not the person you replied to, and due to what is called negative return bias, I don't use leverage even though I understand the argument OP is making.*

Anyway -

Your example **without** leverage:

* $10,000 invested today in something relatively safe (take your pick, looks like you were using S&P earlier)

* It's probably safe to assume - even in bad conditions - a floor of **7% return** per year.

* $10K invested now, growing for 20 years at an average return of 7% per year is **$36,000** roughly.

Take the above math and just multiply it by your leverage. If you're using a 3X Levered ETF, then your 10K will grow to be a little south of **$108,000** after 20 years at a 7% annualized return (buying power will be impacted by 20 years of inflation at 3/5% per year).

However - and I don't mean this to sound crass, but rather protective - if you didn't already sort of know the above, I wouldn't recommend immediately buying into a levered ETF without doing a bit more research than my comment.",1634143569.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q5jsdf/if_youre_young_and_have_a_very_long_investment/hgi3e1e/

Historicly a leverage of 2x on the sp500 (resetting daily) and over 5x for a efficient frontier portfolio of treasuries and equities has lead to the highest gains.

How are many people going to react to 68% or so down for TQQQ in a month or so in early 2020? When things are great, people look at these and go, ""WOW, look at the returns, why wouldn't I?""

Additionally, these questions about leveraged funds (or another thread yesterday about ""long term investing using margin"") rarely ever appear when things are not good.

For your last question, during good times (low volatility, bullish uptrend), TQQQ is a perfect thing to be invested in. Low volatility will make decay less of an issue while of course you'd want to capture all possible gains from a bullish trend.

It's during choppy times that leverage decay becomes a real issue and a leveraged fund's losses will be bigger relative to the non-leveraged version than its gains will be.

1. During a stock crash, bonds will have high negative correlations to stocks so the leverage from TMF will negate any losses from UPRO, even if UPRO is completely liquidated. 
2. A bond ""crash"" from hyperinflation is no longer possible because modern monetary policy will react to inflationary pressures or that inflationary pressures will continue to be present.
3. UPRO due to compounding and daily reset will go up even more than its leverage. 
4. Rebalancing often will force you to take profits from UPRO and shift it to a relatively stable bond ETF.

The potential risks will come from the following scenarios, which mainly comes from the above assumptions no longer being true:

1. Bonds historically, pre-financial crisis, actually did not have such a high negative correlation to stocks so when there is a positive correlation, you would actually see much higher volatility.
2. A shift from low inflation to very high inflation, or a change in the demand for US bonds, can cause both stocks and bonds to fall, resulting in potentially a complete loss of the portfolio.
3. High daily volatility of either UPRO or TMF will cause a downward drift in daily leveraged ETFs, resulting in lower and lower values for a long period.

LETF,Investing,ooxu94,"Debunking the ""Leveraged ETFs Are Not a Long-Term hold"" myth. Big backtest",h62qq1u,"Leverage is generally misunderstood.  It does work both ways as pointed out. If you leverage a bad investment and rebalance frequently you will lose a ton. If you leverage a good investment and re-leverage frequently you can actually add to the returns because you are compounding on compounding.  This can all be confusing but it is a basic idea in finance.

I must point out it is quite easy to create your own leveraged ETF by buying an ETF in a margin account (preferably an account with a low margin rate like Fed Funds plus a small increment).  I've backtested leveraged ETFs (results are on my free wordpress under DailyScreenz) and even with a little leverage and paying a financing cost the returns  compare favorably to the average hedge fund........Happy Hunting!",1626917382.0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ooxu94/debunking_the_leveraged_etfs_are_not_a_longterm/h62qq1u/
LETF,Investing,ooxu94,"Debunking the ""Leveraged ETFs Are Not a Long-Term hold"" myth. Big backtest",h622xg3,"While technically true that B&H leveraged ETF in theory will net you huge gains, MOST people will panic when they see their account draw down 40, 50, 60%+ and be unable to ride out the volatility long term.  

So maybe this could work if you don't check your account for 30 years, or just allocate a portion of your account to it.  

There's actually nothing wrong with using leverage in general.  Kelly criterion suggests optimal leverage of around 1.5-2x for a portfolio depending on mix of stocks and bonds.  

The best way to construct a levered portfolio is to hold a bunch of uncorrelated assets such that your expected risk adj returns are good, then lever it up judiciously.  

Applying huge leverage to a 100% stock portfolio is a terrible idea because there could easily be 90% drawdowns that take a decade+ to recover from.  

IMO no retail investor should use anything more than 2x leverage, and that too with a risk management plan (such as momentum/trend), or with broad diversification across asset classes.

Take a simplistic example of a fund that has a 50% chance of a 10% gain and a 50% chance of a 10% loss on any given day. A 2x fund that is rebalanced daily will of course go up (U) or down (D) 20% in any given day. Comparing returns of the unlevered and the levered funds over 2 days:

UU: 1.1 * 1.1-1 = 21% unlevered return vs 1.2 * 1.2-1 = 44% levered return. More than 2x the return

UD or DU: -1% unlevered vs -4% levered. Worse than 2x the loss

DD: -19% unlevered vs -36% levered. Better than 2x the loss.

Same general principle extends to more than 2 periods, or to the continuous case.

I think people get confused by 2 things: first, they often only consider ""balanced"" returns because that seems the most natural default; second, they tend to think of things in terms of CAGR/geometric returns rather than total return on investment, which can lead to erroneous conclusions.",1626916641.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ooxu94/debunking_the_leveraged_etfs_are_not_a_longterm/h62p6z0/

Yes, this is why I am planning to use the strategy, I get excited by these drops and have hit at least 40% three times now. I always add more to my portoflio. It's always a hugely profitable time to continue investing. You must continue to hold a good chunk of cash though.

If you calculate 2015 to now, the average ratio was 2.95 on positive days and 2.97 on negative days.

It is possible that some of this real data is inaccurate because the change in price was so small on some days that the ratio would be huge.

LETF,Investing,onvr22,Beating the Market with Lower Volatility?,h5vm7i5,"This is a very very very very crowded trade. As in, the majority of wall street is running on the backbone of stock/bond correlations remaining negative. Due to crowding, this has a pretty large tail risk of blowing up, and in doing so, blowing a huge chunk out of the market as a whole.

It's been very profitable and it has a lot of solid fundamental underpinnings, but due to the concentration and other fundamental factors in the Macroeconomy these days, I think over the next 5-10 years, running any type of long-term leveraged stock bond portfolio is going to be a very poor decision from a risk reward perspective. The main risk to consider is that stocks, or at least the heavy duration / tech component of the market are likely to significantly underperform if treasuries sell off. We've seen rumblings of this over the last 1-2 years, but it's becoming stronger and the upside has been waning as bonds upside is much more limited when you're sitting at 0% rates and running hot fiscal policy.

I think something to be mindful of is that it's often the ""safe assets"" that are built to hedge a portfolio that cause the largest blowups in the economy and market. When the embedded assumptions that everyone is going off turn out to no longer hold water, that can be significantly problematic.

&#x200B;

In my opinion, if you want to run a more pure offsetting / hedging strategy using bonds, I would strip out the duration component of your stock portfolio and make the portfolio a version of duration (TLT / treasuries) offsetting commodity exposures (via commodity producing stocks). You probably don't want pure commodity etf's since the negative carry isn't really worthwhile (in my opinion). But owning a basket of stocks that are strong inflation exposures (such as commodity miners, agricultural input companies, energy companies, etc) balanced against treasuries probably would reduce some blowup risk here in my opinion.",1626791007.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/onvr22/beating_the_market_with_lower_volatility/h5vm7i5/

Thats because leveraged ETFs are not for long term holding. 

The first reason is the expense ratio. Its very high. Thats basically a management fee

Second is they need to rebalance leverage daily to match the index. That means some days theyre locking in large short term losses to maintain the objective of the fund. God help you if the index gets stuck sideways and fucks all the range trades. 

Third is the power of compounding. 

Let's say you hold 100k QQQ. Its a crazy day and drops 5% and then goes up 5%. You lose 5% of 100k, drop to 95k and then gain 5% of 95k back up to 99.75k. youve lost .25%

What if you are triple leveraged in TQQQ? Well it drops 15% for you - down to 85k. Now it goes up 15% - but 15% of 85k. Thats 12.75. youre now at 97.75k. thats 2.25% down. 

What if that happens again?

QQQ is 99.5k
TQQQ is 95.5k - overnight fees

Leveraged ETFs are not for beginners. They're something you buy because you are certain an index is gonna do great tomorrow and you want to amplify your returns. And you need to know. Because again if it opens down and then rallies it is gonna effect your returns.

I can't also sell because otherwise I will incur a huge capital gains tax. So this strategy fits perfectly where I'm bullish but a bit nervous on my holdings.

Your comment was so stupid that I forgot to address this point more directly. You saying this is a pretty tell-tale sign you're just making shit up. 





Literally all investment decisions are made by some version of an expected value calculation, direct or otherwise. That is the whole point of an investment. You buy the things that you predict will produce a high return relative to the risk you take on. That is the literal definition of expected return: the summation of the probability of each potential payout multiplied by each potential payout. 






What do you think long-term hedge funds do? Or macro funds? Or algo funds? Or prop shops? They all trade based on some version of expected value. Or do you think they just constantly make negative expected value trades? No. They only do so when it's absolutely necessary such as hedging or quickly selling off. Almost all of their trades are positive expected value trades.







Making positive expected value trades is the definition of generating alpha.

Some will say, yes - but TQQQ charges a very high expense rate (currently .98%) where others are charging as little as .10%, so why would you pay more in expenses?  On the surface that seems logical.  But if I can get a 30% return for .10% in expense, or a 60% return with a higher expense, I'll take the later.

Was working with a friend who recently decided to self-manage her account, and I asked her to do a typical search she uses to look for investment opportunities.  Like me, she likes ETFs.  But she started her search by turning on some filters...stock price less than $25, expense less than .25%, top 25% in returns, AUM of more than $1B, etc.  While expenses are important, they should, IMHO, never trump results.  If you are going to invest $2500, what possible difference does the price make?  And yes, AUM matters in terms of liquidity, but means little to a long-term investor.

LETF,Investing,nzhki5,Give me reasons to choose SPY over QQQ,h1plnpn,"I'll shortly explain my reasoning: TQQQ being a 3x ETF can be modeled through a simple differential equation which shows that its returns over long time are three times the logaritmic returns QQQ divided by a factor which depends on daily volatily: the higher the daily volatility the higher it is, the worse it gets. So for long term returns' sake it does not really matter if qqq has dipped itself, but market crashes usually bring higher volatility and that's where the problem lies. The thing is, you need a HUGE volatility in respect to gains to actually perform worse than QQQ, and this did not even happen with covid crash. So either there is a gargantuan crash with crazy high volatility or TQQQ wins (whether dot com bubble actually was so bad to do what I said i do not know, I am only saying that maybe even that was not enough do destroy TQQQ)

LETF,Investing,nskvfp,Why does the SSO outperform the SPY?,h0n2jik,"When SPY goes nearly straight up or straight down (such as with the covid crash), SSO will be close to 2x or -2x like you noted. It’s when the underlying is very volatile and repeatedly swings up and down that you really see the decay in action. 

Quoting another comment I made, just substitute QQQ and TQQQ (3x leverage) with SPY and SSO:

>	If you had $100 in QQQ and it drops 5% in one day and rises 5% the next, you’d have $99.75 and be down 0.25% overall. With TQQQ, you’d end up with $97.75 and be down not 0.75% but actually 2.25%. So when markets are very volatile, leveraged ETFs experience this decay and that’s why they’re not recommended as a long term investment.

So with your example, the decay is why you’d be up 40% and not 2x 31 = 62% on SSO. That’s all there is to decay really, it’s just math associated with the nature of leverage.",1622858549.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nskvfp/why_does_the_sso_outperform_the_spy/h0n2jik/

LETF,Investing,nl9l9d,Buying and holding leveraged ETFs,gzhk5eu,"The most a triple leveraged (index) fund can drop in one day is 60%, since trading will be halted for the day after a 20% drop in the index. With daily rebalancing, the following day you can again only lose, at most, 60% of the remaining value before trading halts. The means on day 1 your portfolio will be worth 40% of the day before; day 2, 16%; day 3, 6.4%; and so on.

If you’re buying a leveraged index ETF, you don’t need to worry about it going to 0. There will be daily rebalancing, and reverse splits, that prevent that from occurring.

That being said, there is very high risk with these ETFs. I like to imagine it as being (3x) long the index, while also being short (non-leveraged) volatility. If volatility spikes while prices increase, the ETF value will increase, since the 3x long “outweighs” the 1x “short volatility”. If volatility spikes while price remains constant or decreases, you lose money from both your 3x long and 1x “short volatility” position. This of course isn’t perfectly accurate and mainly just an approximation, but it helps get the point across, to me at least.

So, think of it this way: would you hold a position that is 3x long QQQ or SPY, and 1x short VIX? If not, don’t hold TQQQ or UPRO without a hedge. There’s been lots of discussion on various forums about viable strategies to hold 3x leveraged funds, and being long bonds as 40-60% of your portfolio with the remainder dedicated to 3x leveraged funds seems to be the most stable over time. There’s still risk involved of course.

If you’re planning on going all-in on 3x leveraged ETFs, be prepared to lose 60% of your portfolio every day during a black swan event. If that is an acceptable risk and you’re bullish on the index, then take it. If not, consider a small position and/or hedging the position with appropriate products (long volatility with rebalancing? bonds? metals? many possibilities here).

The key with these leveraged ETFs, from my experience, is timing the market. Everyone who has failed will tell you it’s impossible, and everyone who has succeeded will tell you that you just need to pay attention to the right things. Personally, I think it’s all bullshit and they got lucky, but to each their own. If you’re going to hold leveraged ETFs, be prepared to sell on the slightest hint of a bad time, and at the very least set up stop loss orders to minimize your suffering in the event of a crash. 

Disclaimer: currently long TQQQ and UPRO as a not-insignificant portion of my portfolio. My hedging methods are currently mostly untested (since both my TQQQ and UPRO positions are green), so I’ve given some generic hedging advice above. Take it with a grain of salt.

Another note, assuming you hold both UPRO and TQQQ, exclusively: a 20% drop in SPY causes a trading halt until the following day, *market-wide*, whereas a 20% drop in QQQ caused a trading halt until the following day *for QQQ*, to the best of my knowledge. If, for some reason, SPY hits -20% in one day before QQQ does, trading on QQQ (and TQQQ) will halt till the following day, meaning your portfolio will drop by *less* than 60%. Likewise, if QQQ drops -20% in a day, trading will be halted, while SPY may not drop that much, again resulting in a less than 60% loss of your portfolio.",1622012826.0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nl9l9d/buying_and_holding_leveraged_etfs/gzhk5eu/

LETF,Investing,nl9l9d,Buying and holding leveraged ETFs,gzkc5gs,"I made another comment correcting the above - specifically, that QQQ *can* theoretically fall more than 20% in one day. The following will apply only to SPY/UPRO.

Yes, 60% is the (target) daily max loss. The circuit break on SPY will halt *all* trading for the day at -20%, and UPRO will therefore halt at (around) -60%. This is partially the job of market makers, to find inefficiencies in the market and correct/exploit them. If SPY is trading at -15% DoD, and UPRO is trading below -45% DoD, there should exist sufficient buying pressure from market makers and other institutions to move the price closer to the true value of the ETFs holdings. This may not be exactly -45% (since UPRO’s holdings for the day may not be *exactly* tracking 3x SPY), but it should be close.

Note, however, that I stated *daily* max loss. UPRO should halt somewhere around -60%. Normally, it would be rebalanced at the end of the day; however, if the markets of its holdings are halted, it cannot be rebalanced, meaning you might be exposed to the *previous day’s* leverage the following day, leading to a “UPRO-to-0” scenario if the next day opens below -33% (relative to the previous-day’s open). That being said, most holdings of 3x-leveraged ETFs are not “simple” stocks or derivatives, and they are often traded off-exchange, meaning they can be rebalanced OTC in the event of a halt.",1622064966.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nl9l9d/buying_and_holding_leveraged_etfs/gzkc5gs/

LETF,Investing,nl9l9d,Buying and holding leveraged ETFs,gzk5db0,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_curb?wprov=sfti1

It would appear as though I was partially mistaken. I will likely update my strategy because of this. What actually occurs to any security in S&P 500, Russel 1000, or QQQ is any price movement of greater than 10% of the last day’s close results in a 15-minute halt. So the actual advice should be as follows:

In the occurrence of a black swan event, QQQ can only drop by, at most 10% every 15 minutes. A drop of 10% is highly likely, but not guaranteed, to correspond to a drop of at least 7% on S&P, triggering a market-wide halt. If not, the halt of all QQQ-listed securities (for 15 minutes) will likely result in the bid-ask of QQQ to become quite wide due to the difficultly of price discovery while all of their assets aren’t trading. This corresponds to a 30% drop in TQQQ before a temporary halt occurs.

So it is theoretically possible for TQQQ to drop more than 60% in one day. It would require that all of its holdings *not in the S&P 500* drop more than 20% in one day. Due to how many stocks are listed in both, you would need a pretty severe drop in the others (with those listed in both dropping <20%) for QQQ to drop >20% while S&P drops <20%.

So, TL;DR: it is possible for TQQQ to drop more than 60% in one day; however, it requires S&P 500 to drop less than 20% while the few (relatively) insignificant holdings of QQQ to drop significantly more than 20%. TQQQ should also not drop more than 30% in a short period of time without all of its holdings halted; price discovery at -30% will be difficult, but it should be reasonable to come up with a strategy to sell as a stop-loss just before a 30% drawdown.

Edit: and yes, I would also recommend UPRO from a risk perspective; however, QQQ has historically performed better than SPY, so depending on risk tolerance (and hedging strategies), it may still be beneficial to consider TQQQ over UPRO, at least for a portion of one’s triple-leveraged portfolio.",1622061825.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nl9l9d/buying_and_holding_leveraged_etfs/gzk5db0/

The market has halts in place if the market sells off at 7% which stops the market for 15 minutes. Plenty of time to get.out of TQQQ at 21% loss. I personally buy above the 200 dma and sell when it dip below it. This was back tested on seeking alpha for upro on a daily triple leverage etf all the way back to 1933 and captured an annualized rate of return of 16% by following this strategy. I prefer tqqq because tech is the way. I still hold tqqq and will not sell unless under 200 dma. I only do this with 10% of my portfolio and it has doubled and tripled many times already.

LETF,Investing,lnvmsb,3x Leveraged ETF Long Term,goe8u5d,"I think many people here, when they are talking about ""decay"", don't quite get it. Sorry.  Investing in leveraged ETFs is not about decay.

It is about volatility and DCA.

If you invest $1 in TQQQ in 2010, it is worth $100 today.

If you put in $100 in TQQQ today, I'm very confident that in 10 years, it'll be a lot more than if it were to put that $100 into something like SPY, or QQQ.

As long as QQQ goes up over time, TQQQ will go up over time.  3x that much. Likely more than 3x that much.

So what's the problem?  The problem is that as an investor, you do not put all of your money into TQQQ at once.  You don't have all the money you invest.  You get paid monthly and make investments monthly -- or periodically.   This is where the volatility of TQQQ can hurt you, when you buy in at the wrong time.

LETF,Investing,lj8jek,Using leveraged ETF's for a less volatile higher return portfolio,gneccuc,"I wouldn't commit everything to 3X funds. There's a greater likelihood of these higher leveraged funds closing down in a crisis - either because the AUM drops so low the fund is no longer profitable or the SEC shuts it down because investors lose so much. You could be forced to lock in the deep losses of a 3x position without the opportunity for 3x returns to recover. 

Also, treasuries and equities have exhibited strong negative correlation when rates are generally falling as they have been for decades. But the correlations tend to turn positive when rates are rising. Fortunately, rates tend to fall during market/financial crises but if we go through a crisis and long term rates go up instead of fall this portfolio would get hammered. The gold, VIX, and cash in your original portfolio give some diversification of your diversifier in case the next crisis doesn't look like recent ones. These allocations probably look like a drag on return when you look at recent historical data but they could be insurance if the future looks different from the recent past. 

One other thing to examine is whether the 2x or 3x treasury has much benefit over 1x long term zero coupon funds like ZROZ or EDV. Zero coupon increases the duration (interest rate sensitivity) lowering the correlation which can be more beneficial in a portfolio than leveraging the return and volatility.",1613308575.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lj8jek/using_leveraged_etfs_for_a_less_volatile_higher/gneccuc/

One prediction that I have for the future, maybe in the next ten years, is that regulators will force companies to share their data as data becomes more and more of a valuable asset. For example Google may be forced to share their search data in order to promote competitiveness, not share their algorithms. We may even see companies a step ahead of this and doing it voluntarily, basically open sourcing data. I'm sure an amount of this goes on already. It also in theory could benefit all companies if they share data as it may add value to and grow their market as a whole.

I don't think that what you're suggesting is particularly novel or it's at least not something that's that new to me. The thing with software is its ability to leverage and scale up for quick growth is also what allows it to have a quick demise when a better solution comes along.

I will give you a quote which I've learned from a business course (paraphrasing) ""The only sustainable advantage that you have over competitors is to innovate quicker than them"".

I can't speak to any of the companies that you've mentioned as I wouldn't invest in them because I don't understand the technology or know the industry. I am however invested in most of the largest tech companies, mostly for the reasons that you've mentioned, i.e. moat: 

- Microsoft - 'lock in' effect with business products, e.g. office and outlook, windows. It all works together. Probably my most confident long term investment of my tech stocks.

- Google: network effect moat with their search engine. They also have a great online ecosystem: maps, gmail, google drive, google docs. Like an online microsoft office.

- Facebook: massive network effects: facebook, whatsapp, instagram. They can just buy any competitors.

- Amazon: economies of scale moat. I can't see anyone disrupting their ecommerce business very easily. I can't speak for AWS as I'm not sure how protectable that is from other cloud providers.

Yes, Buffet is the person that popularized the major concept. 2. There are many different types of moats 3. Those moats do tend to get stagnant and shallow over time.

The idea behind the strategy is here is that companies are forced to innovate through data (step 3: improve) or else they lose that comp advantage.

This wasn't a post about moats in general, I was clear that this is a post about one specific most strategy.

I was also very clear to point out that this is a compounding moat strategy, meaning that each step has to be in place for it to be a meaningful strategy.

Of course there are loads of companies with high switching costs or a multi-product strategy. 

The point is that there aren't many companies who have both of those things and are also successfully executing on a data strategy that allows them to help their customers over time.

The fact that investors hated the Slack acquisition is my evidence for this. For Salesforce, the network effects are SO strong in terms of what they empower 'within' a business (ie analytics gets along much better with sales, support gets along much better with finance, etc) that the Slack acquisition should basically double their valuation IMO. 

It supercharges the key ingredient of why companies like their products (deeper integration across silos) and it gives them access to a MASSIVE book of business they can cross-sell into specifically in a market that's challenging for big CRM players to get to (SMEs).

I doubled my holdings after the acquisition, and it's the biggest single position currently at about 10% of my portfolio.

LETF,Investing,l0vkkl,Big investment opportunities in tech companies who adopt this business strategy,gjzad4r,"MS Teams, Slack, and the original cloud collaboration problem, the G-Suite are all examples of a whole new trend towards 'digital workspace design', basically setting up a digital office (ie a space that employees do specific tasks) in the same way that you would consider a physical office. Where do you put the filing cabinets. Where do you put IT support. What access can you create to things that help employees do their jobs better.

A senior Microsoft exec was recently quoted as saying that the Teams app may come to be a more important application than the internet browser. Sounds a bit silly to our present day ears, but imagining what an app like Teams may look like in a decade after businesses take a true crack at structuring their workforces and productivity around it. 

My expectation is that CRM will do the same thing, but that they will focus on the segment of the market that's more geared to the scrappy, more creative side of business. Tech-startups. Ad agencies.

LETF,Investing,kz6fgt,"Q: leveraged indices (SSO, UPRO, TQQQ...)",gjo57wz,"Leveraged funds in sectors I think are a bad idea, like gold, oil, whatever.

Indeces are a different story. Every horror-story about leveraged funds uses the same volatility drag argument about 100$ up 10% to 110$ down 10% to 99$ and your fund is down to like 92$ and you die. Problem is, and you can check this, the indeces all go up roughly 66% of the time, I think dow does like 72% of the time for one time period I checked. So volatility drag isn't true for INDEX LEVERAGED.

People also mention fees, 1% fee is supposed to drop the effect of leveraging to below the expected, such that 2 or 3x leveraged is only really the same performance as 1x leverage. This is false, in fact tqqq outperforms the programmatic 3x target in my testing.

Crash recovery, I mean this really depends on the resiliency of the fund. TQQQ was in a ROUGH and dangerous spot in march. But the amount of capital it has gives it some resilience. You can see in the lower volume ETFs, like the direxion 2 or 3x SP500, they fail to hit their leverage target. This can be a problem, so I would only use highly liquid funds with a lot of activity. Aside from some jaw dropping falls of 70+%, these climb out of holes just fine if the indeces do. however, if you sell, like a lot of people will want to, you're screwed.

I have done fairly extensive back-testing to try and find buy-sell signals using moving averages, MACD type stuff, also interest rates growth and shrinkage, and stop-losses, and I cannot find any signal that works when backtested over the full index histories I have (\~40 years, dow is longer). Some signals work very very well for an individual year (like it's quite easy to 7x your money in 2020, if you just know the magic signal, but that signal is worse than being passive in 2012), but there's no universal strategy I can find.

I think if your horizon is order of years, it's fine, and I'm holding 30% in TQQQ. I am not the kind of person that will NEED that 30% though, so make your own decisions accordingly.

LETF,Investing,kz6fgt,"Q: leveraged indices (SSO, UPRO, TQQQ...)",gjo3egw,"I've backtested as long as dow, russel, nasdaq, s&p have been indexes by applying the leverage programmatically.  I can reproduce tqqq from the nasdaq for a given year, but over 3+ years, tqqq strangely always outperforms the programmatic 3x leverage.

It works basically because indeces always go up, actually 66% of days give or take, all 4 major indeces go up. This demolishes the volatility drag ""sideways market"" scenario.

For any yearlong period, the best leverage is either 0x or infinity x. So, with time horizons on the order of years, they can be very very bad investments. Over decades though, all of them work.

I'm not positive how well backtesting works tbh. I'm testing out golden-death-cross and MACD buy-sell signals, and it's just a complete disaster. like 3-15 works well in the last 5 years since it dodges the crash, but not much beats buy-and-hold for 2012-2016/2018, and the stuff that does work, doesn't obviously skip dips, it just hangs on a mathematical optimum. 2001-2007 same story. Even interest rates can't fix it, since flat, descending, ascending all have different buy-sell signals in different eras.

I've been trying the 1990s and the 1980s, and still no global success trade-pattern emerges, and no obvious failure for the funds does either.",1610930226.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kz6fgt/q_leveraged_indices_sso_upro_tqqq/gjo3egw/
LETF,Investing,kz6fgt,"Q: leveraged indices (SSO, UPRO, TQQQ...)",gmvn4ni,"I guess it really depends on the shape of the recovery. For example last 2 weeks we had a few days in a row of 1-2% drops, but that's followed by a day of 3% gain, then slower 1% gain. So if we pretend it's -2% -2% -2% +3% +1%x4 --> unleveraged = 101%, leveraged = 102% ... but if you sell and miss the +3% day unleveraged = 98% and leveraged = 94%

Basically, the reason I think something like tqqq, udow, upro are okay is because they go up 66% of the time (as opposed to focused leveraged etfs in oil or gold or something). Since it's very difficult to predict the direction beyond that (I mean, I've tried with moving averages and such, but it's not apparent to me if you can), each day you basically have a 66% chance, top or bottom.

I think it's more critical at the bottom because rebounds are generally steeper at the bottom (you should check this yourself, this is just a ""feeling"" for me -- for daily swings, covid or catastrophes! I don't know about a slow rolling bear!). So optimally you want to hold at least until recovery is on the way, unless you are better than me at predicting when the drop will continue and it's good to get out.

So basically I think near the bottom, each day you have a 66% chance of it going up, and the farther down you are, the larger the bounce will be. So selling then is much worse than selling any other day.

To play safe, I think a strategy like this works well: when it's down 5%, buy 5%, when it's up 5%, sell 5%, but only sell at or above your previous sell price. (but watch out for taxes)

LETF,Investing,kz6fgt,"Q: leveraged indices (SSO, UPRO, TQQQ...)",gjoat6a,"My 40 year data is pulled from yfinance using the index tickers

sp500, nasdaq, russel, dow = '\^GSPC', '\^IXIC', '\^RUT', '\^DJI'

I'm applying the 3x leveraging by multiplying the daily price change percentage at close by 3. This tracks tqqq well for yearlong stretches, although tqqq seems to actually outperform the target and the difference becomes noticeable over 3+ year stretches.

I also did a bunch of reading via the google. I came to the conclusions 1) volatility drag doesn't matter for index leveraged funds since the underlying have 66% positive trends (it's probably bad for something like gold or oil leverage) 2) admin fees do not actually drawdown the performance to be on par with the underlying index 3) catastrophic drops pull out over long (5 years to be safe) timescales 4) there's no magic buy-sell signal that works for timeframes longer than a couple of years, and they change based on year 5) any given year the optimal leverage is either 0x or inf x, over lifetimes only russel and s&p prefer 2x over 3x (I think that the nikkei actually prefers 1x, which was odd, I haven't tested this one myself).

that's my backtesting vs the common arguments I see in articles. Caveat though, I doubt the usefulness of backtesting since I can't find a buy-sell signal that works for a large stretch, even though there are some amazing ones for each year. The market is fluid and reacts in ways different from the past.

LETF,Investing,kz6fgt,"Q: leveraged indices (SSO, UPRO, TQQQ...)",gjodffk,"It's...not simple.  I have avoided using margin and have not used leveraged ETFs.  However, this has more to do with my personal risk tolerance. (I'm a chicken and I know it.) 

I can't help but think that leveraged ETFs, regardless of history, are probably a bad idea.  It wouldn't be difficult for them to lose and lose big.  Additionally, they tend to charge a pretty decent fee.  Leverage on margin is interesting.  Using 1% margin is probably decent; you are very unlikely to get margin called, for example.  You'll probably magnify your returns by a tiny bit, as market growth usually exceeds the interest charged on margin. (I've thought of investing on margin as the opposite of keeping a portion of your account in cash.  With margin, you're paying interest to magnify your returns.  With cash, you're getting interest, but your returns are muted.) The big question, though, is where do you draw the line?  10%?  30%?  At some point, you're running high risks of getting margin called due to volatility.  

In short, I don't have answers on which is preferable.  I've always taken the view that you should deeply understand the mechanics of whatever you are doing, but that the level of risk is up to the individual.

LETF,Investing,k3m9aa,(X) Risk Premium? But what are at Risk?,ge4hjg1,"""risk"" in the context you're using it has a very specific meaning - higher variability of returns in any specific period of time. It's not the same as ""risk of loss"" (which is how most people think intuitively). 

To use your example, if you have money in SPY maybe over 20 years you have an expected, annualized return of 10%. However, in any one of those years, there's a lot of variance - you could be at -5%, +15%, etc etc varying widely around that average.

> It seem to me that there are only benefit and zero risk long term to take on, ironically, more risk.

The deeper and more interesting question is whether you're actually getting paid your risk premia. 

For example, in a hot market where asset prices are very high, everyone has already made that same calculation that you did, and they're willing to take a lower risk premium in search of higher returns (because the markets are going up and people are only perceiving the positive side of risk). When markets have been down for awhile and assets are cheap, you get a higher risk premium than you would investing today.

LETF,Investing,jly39l,Unpopular opinion time: people under 30 should not invest in vtsax,gat5r5c,"I think there are really 3 arguments here.

1)  VTSAX vs. VTI

As someone who started out when ETFs don't exist and thus has a bias towards mutual funds I think ETFs are the superior **default** product.  There are still quite a few strategies you can't get in an ETF.  VTSAX isn't one of them.  Any young person I can think of should pick VTI over VTSAX if they can (i.e  they might not be able to in a 401k)  

2)  Should young people use leverage if they can get it cheaply?  

Here I think the data is clear, yes they should mathematically.    OTOH there is real risk of a wipeout and younger investors often don't handle balancing out various risks as well as older investors.  Financial leverage makes mistakes a lot more costly the same way speeding make driving mistakes a lot more costly.  Youth investing is partially about making mistakes when they aren't devesting to your life so you don't make them when you are.  Even though I understand the math for leverage, and I use a lot of leverage in my personal portfolio (though generally on things like bond spreads not stocks) I don't have my early 20s daughter use leverage since she's learning the basics.   I'd be somewhat cautious about having kids go through wipeouts.  

So a little leverage maybe if they can get it cheaply but not a ton.    Let young people focus on boosting their lifetime income and worry about how to optimize investing in complex ways their 50s.  That's the right order to do things in.  

3)  Are  TQQQ and UPRO a good way for a young person to achieve cheap leverage?  

A broadly diversified portfolio is key.  QQQ is not diversified.  The SP500 is better but also heavy in tech and both of them are almost 100% USA.  Huge numbers of sectors aren't in them...  This is a bad portfolio.  Though UPRO is somewhat worse than VTI in terms of diversification and TQQQ much worse than VTI. 

I can imagine using leveraged etfs for a leveraged portfolio (though daily rebalancing can be devastating in up and down choppy markets that can last for years).  I certainly would and do recommend younger investors learn about asset allocation before learning about leverage.",1604251818.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/jly39l/unpopular_opinion_time_people_under_30_should_not/gat5r5c/

Firstly: check out $TMF's performance from 2011 to 2018, a time when interest rates were held steady at the same rate they are at now following the GFC. Already low interest rates does not mean $TMF cannot or won't appreciate in price.

The interesting thing about AAR Corp is that roughly 47% of their revenue stream comes in from defense work and this sector of their business is growing rapidly. Additionally 13% of their revenue comes in from cargo carriers which is a growing industry with Covid.

I believe that short term they are going to take a couple of bad quarters, but their Q4 was the worst of it and yet still beat expectations by 18%. Long term though, AAR Corp and MRO companies in general will do well due to airline industries desire to hold on to planes for much longer than they would normally. New planes don’t need fixing but old ones do. Struggling airlines will be much less apt to buy new fleets of planes and hold onto old planes for longer. Older planes need to be fixed significantly more than newer planes. This will help the MRO industry as a whole.

Education Tech company that enables universities to drastically increase online tuition revenue by handling literally everything from marketing to curriculum to admissions to academic support/advising to internship placement.

Universities are quickly understanding that online program revenues are far more lucrative since they can admit exponentially more students from all across the country (and even the world). Having a partner like 2U, who can create the entirety of your online program from the ground up for you, is a hell of a proposition for universities.

2U is also continuing to expand into international markets with international universities, and has a long-term outlook for growth.

Chronically undervalued smallcap Canadian renewable energy producer that owns a geothermal plant in Nicaragua, three hydroelectric plants in Peru, and have signed a letter of intent to build one in Panama

They have remained chronically undervalued due to distrust around the Nicaraguan regime, but were breaking out after their successful expansion into Peru before COVID took them back down.

They trade well below book value and only about 4x cashflow, have pretty low debt for an infrastructure company, and their EPS is due to rise this quarter and next because their contracts for the new hydro plants only activated in May. Compared to other renewable energy players, they trade at something like a 75% discount by EBITA

It's not a stock where I can guarantee they will shoot up at a specific point, but if you want a 7% yield at a 40% payout ratio while waiting for the market to price it appropriately, or for it to get acquired by a bigger player, it's attractive.

LETF,Investing,hhsn0z,TQQQ Test Run Website,fwcoxcx,"Here's a quick rundown.

**Geometric series**

\- A stock that goes up 5% and down 5% will lose value (105% \* 95% =  99.75%).

\- A stock that goes up and down 5% several times will lose lots of value (99.75% \^ 10 = 97.53%).

Now, this effect is multiplied with leveraged ETFs:

\- Leveraged x3, that stock now goes up 15% and down 15% (115% \* 85% =  97.75%).

\- By doing this several times, value is lost drastically (97.75% \^ 10 = 79.65%).

As you can see, where the value of the holdings lost just under 2.5%, the leveraged holdings lost over 20%. Volatility is the killer here.

**It's Easier to Lose Money than Gain Money**

The above example assumes the stock will remain flat. However, what if you're bullish?

Let's say our stock gained 25% and lost 15% in a month. This would be a really good month, since 125% \* 85% = 106.25%. We would've made a 6.25% return in that month.

Wouldn't a 3x leveraged stock return 18.75% (3 \* 6.25%)?

Nope, it'll actually **lose** money! Leveraged 3x, we'd see a 75% gain and 45% loss, and 175% \* 55% = 96.25%.

Over a year? The regular stock will have more-than-doubled at 206.99% (106.25% \^ 12), and the 3x leverage stock would be worth less than two-thirds of the original investment at 63.21% (96.25% \^ 12).

**This Assumes Volatility**

The obvious killer here is volatility, which not only makes you extremely negative when the annual returns are flat, but leaves you negative even while the stock doubles annually.

How do you make money from TQQQ? A low-volatility bull run.

How do you lose money from TQQQ? A high-volatility bull run, a flat market, or any kind of bear run.

Why do we only hold the TQQQ short-term? Because there's bound to be a volatile period if you hold long-term. Be patient, wait for a greedy market and sell fast.",1593423081.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hhsn0z/tqqq_test_run_website/fwcoxcx/

LETF,Investing,gy2ghd,Is there something missing or can someone provide an example why 3x ETFs don’t work?,ft8bwec,"I'm going to disagree with some of the people here and make a case for leveraged ETFs. The major feature of these products is the daily tracking of an index. This means that the leveraged ETF doesn't actually track the index but the percentage daily movement. This can be a problem during periods of high volatility because a large percentage down means it takes a greater percentage to come back to the same value. For example even though UPRO/SPXL did not exist in 2007 at the start of the great recession, we can backtest its value. 10000 at the top on 10/9/2007 would result in around 440 at the low on 3/9/2009, a drawdown of 96%, compared to SPY, which suffered a 56% drop.
This is a risk that you take with almost all leveraged products. 

Why would you take such a highly risky position then? Some people call the daily reset a ""decay"" because if the index moved one direction and came back to the starting value on the second day, the leveraged ETF will have a lower overall value. This is true only if the index moves in random directions. However, we all know that in the long run, the S&P 500 will likely increase.

During a bull market, the daily reset actually works for you, not against you because the leveraged ETF can increase by more than 3x the index. SPY increased by about 4.7 times the lows in 2009. If we don't count the recent crash, if you bought SPXL at the lows in 2009, you would have not 3x4.7=14.1 times more than your initial investment but **53** times. During the last bull market, SPXL increased by more than 10 times the value of SPY. If you timed the market correctly, and added stop losses to mitigate a crash, the reward more than makes up for much of the risks.

There are other strategies to mitigate the risks aside from using stop losses such as adding another leveraged ETF, TMF as a hedge. I would say that TMF is actually very powerful in any portfolio as a hedge because in a bear market, investors don't all exit the market entirely but move to bonds, decreasing bond yields and increasing the value of the bond ETFs. During the recent crash and before the recovery, TMF went up 50% so even though SPXL crashed, at the bottom, if you had 50% in TMF and 50% in SPXL, you were actually doing better than someone only holding SPY.

Also important to note is that leveraged ETFs can be rewarding but not to more passive or retail investors. You have to pay close attention to potential market crashes and rebalance frequently if you use a hedge. You also need some success in market timing, which is possible if you know a lot about economics/finance.",1591497747.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/gy2ghd/is_there_something_missing_or_can_someone_provide/ft8bwec/

I thought about this too. Maybe the replies of daily reseting, and larger % changes making it harder to recover from longer downswings doesn't help fully see why a leveraged wouldn't outperform over 20 years. 

I'm no data visualizer, so this is just a quick and dirty graph, but basically, going back to May 2007 and plotting the daily changes in the SP500 vs. a 2x, 3x, 4x, and 5x leveraged SP500 to the present day shows that a 2x barellllly beats the market while a 3x lags behind and 4x and 5x never recover from the 2008 recession. 

I myself still need a bit of convincing though, because this comparison goes through 2 recessions. If you invested in 2009 (could try graphing it yourself), the leveraged SP500s do perform MUCH better (even accounting for the dip this March). So yes, it is risky to invest in leverages and hold long term. 2 extreme drops in \~10 years will cause you to perform worse than the market. You can mayyyyyybe survive 1 extreme drop. I could see holding a 3x as part of a portfolio, but nothing huge.

Market up 1%:  Index: $101 /3x: $103  /Difference: 2$

Down 1%:  Index back to 99.99 /3x back to: 99.91/ Difference +$0.08 for index

Market up 1%: Index: 100.989 / 3x: 102.91 / Difference: +$1.921 for 3x

Market down 1%: Index: 99.98 / 3x: 99.82 / Difference:  +$0.16 for index

Market up 1%: Index:  100.978/ 3x:  102.81 / Difference: +$1.832 for 3x

So you can see with more up/down movements the difference between the two become closer until eventually the 1x fund will surpass the 3x fund because the 3x fund is losing more on down swings.

Now look at an example with higher volatility: Starting with $100

Market up 5%: Index $105 / 3x: $115

Market down 5%: Index: $99.75 / 3x: $97.75

If the market went straight up, then yes the 3x fund would return more over the long run, but in reality the market goes up and down when growing in value. **The core reason 3x funds are bad for a long term hold is the 3x fund loses significantly more on down swings.**",1584900991.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fn3si5/buying_leveraged_etfs_is_the_only_long_term/fl7g2g9/

LETF,Investing,fn3si5,Buying Leveraged ETFs is the only Long Term Investment that Makes Sense Right Now,fl7u22q,"OP - someone posted  [this article](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4226165-trading-strategy-beat-s-and-p-500-16-percentage-points-per-year-since-1928) recently. Two things that stuck out to me: 

- the up/down ratio of the market isn't 50:50, it's 53:47

> On any given day, the odds of the market going up or down are not 50/50. Additionally, stock returns do not follow a normal distribution, as is commonly assumed in many models. On any given day, the market has roughly a 53 percent chance of rising. The odds of the market rising over longer periods increases continually as the time period you're looking at increases. Daily market returns are also streaky. You are statistically more likely to have multi-day winning streaks during uptrends. This plays into our hands.

- The author basically claims that crashes happen when the market is below the 200 SMA. In order to minimize downside risk, he advocates for using a more conservative number. 

> Volatility is almost twice as high when stocks are below their 200-day moving average than when they're above it.

> This indeed allows us to isolate the instances when we are most likely to experience significant market declines and the times when 3x leverage is most likely to underperform the index due to volatility drag.

> By doing this, you also are able to identify environments when market crashes are more likely to occur. As you can see, over two-thirds of the worst trading days for the market occur when the S&P 500 is trading below its 200-day moving average.

....

> Additionally, I recommend a 1 percent band around the 200-day average to prevent being whipsawed as the market hovers near its 200-day average. Let it close 1 to 1.25 percent below before you sell and wait for it to go 1 percent above before you buy. Additionally, you may want to consider using the 150 or 175-day averages as they're less popular with traders. 200-day moving average traders are still smart money, but the fewer people you have selling when you want to sell and vice versa when you buy, the better. I'd use the moving average on the S&P even though we're trading the Nasdaq as it's a volatility forecaster, not a market timing model.

First off is your post about leveraged ETF or about tech stocks? Pick one or the other. You can't rely on the fact that tech has soared in the past 20 years to make claims about leverage.

OK so let's see if your claims work out with S&P indexes. 

We're 30% down right now. So let's say you invested in 2008 when the market went down 30% and held until today. That would have been invested on mid September 2008. VOO has returned 140% while SOO returned 190%. You'd expect 280%. That's a lot of decay that's not worth the terrible emotions you feel watching your money go down so much.

I believe my rebuttal to this would be that in your example, we would expect to see that a 3x Leveraged ETF would not perform well over a long time period. **However** we do see that the stock ticker such as TECL or UPRO has consistently been positive over the long run and out perform there non leveraged counterparts such as QQQ and SPY.   


The only downside is a 3x Leverage ETF would seem to underperform if you were to buy them in a bull market right before a crash. Since we already had that crash and we expect to reach a bottom within 2020 or 2021, a leverage ETF seems like the best suited investment to take advantage of our bullish longterm investment thesis.

I'm not sure this is why leveraged is a bad idea. The down days are made up during uptrends when the 3x ETF returns MORE than 3x because of compounding.

Decay I think refers to something (which I admitedely don't understand) about having to buy more stocks at the end of the day in up markets to maintain 3x exposure. When the market goes up a bunch in a day, the 3x ETF naturally loses it 3x exposure. To make up for that it has to buy MORE derivitives when the market is up -- which essentially means buying more when the market is going up and less when the market is going down (which is obviously bad).",1584904044.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fn3si5/buying_leveraged_etfs_is_the_only_long_term/fl7l7ma/

I think TQQQ in a bullish run would be disastrous because the main time a leveraged ETF will underperform is if you buy it during a bull run and then the market crashes  


During a Market crash however, they seem to be the most logical investment for dollar cost averaging if we expect the market to recover within 5 years.  


I think I may have a higher risk tolerance then normal because i have relatively low living expenses and if I my portfolio goes down 60% im okay with it. With this leveraged ETF strategy, if the market goes down another 30% a 3x levaraged ETF would lose around 60-70% of its value (it would be less then 90% because of daily re-balancing) I think if an investor can stomach the volatility and understand that whatever they put in a 3x Leverage ETF has a good chance of losing 40% of its value in the short term, this investment in 5 years seems like the obvious play for long term return

But even in an uptrend it would have to be massive to make up for the losses from the down days.

If you bought in the 3x funds today and the market dropped another 20%.

$100 -> $40

To get back to your original investment of $100 you would need a 250% increase in the 3x fund aka an 83.33% increase in the market just to make it back to break even.  While at the same time if you were just in a 1x fund you would go:

$100 -> $80 -> +83.33% increase = $146.66 = 1x would be up 46.66% while the 3x hasn't gained any at all. So how much of an increase would it need to be to surpass the 1x fund then? 

$40 \* 450% increase = $180 (3x)

$80 \* 150% increase = $180 (1x)

So in this scenario the market would have to increase %150 before the 3x fund would then pass it profitability but this is ignoring decay from natural volatility because the market doesn't go straight down then straight up",1584905023.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fn3si5/buying_leveraged_etfs_is_the_only_long_term/fl7munv/

OK good. Then stop talking about QQQ and TQQQ, an start talking about the index.  

> During a Market crash however, they seem to be the most logical investment for dollar cost averaging if we expect the market to recover within 5 years. 

DCA seems to be a bad idea in such cases. You just said that we're going to count on a sharp uptick within 5 years. DCA will mean you aren't locking in the low prices when they're available. If you're going to gamble with leverage, you have to lock in the low price while they're here. 

> Of course that lost would be detrimental, but since I am dollar cost averaging, the average cost of my investments would most likely be near the bottom 

That is 100% not going to happen. DCA would mean you're buying on the way down, at the bottom (assuming your get super luck and pick the right day of the week), and during the uptrend.

LIBOR is near 1.6%. But that’s the rate for large banks with bargaining power.

The buyer of TMF has no bargaining power, so let’s add 50 basis points of “spread” on the borrowed funds. So the cost of borrowing embedded in the TMF swaps is 2.1%. Note: the seller of the swap, a big bank, earns this spread as a fee.

So now we are looking at a net yield for TMF of 1.8% = (2% * 3) - (2.1% * 2).

Also read about ""risk parity"" and how they work. AQR has many great articles on the subject.

It can work. But it is risky. They look great the last 10 years, the longest bull market. Leveraged ETFs will suffer a lot if there are big drops in a short time, and markets tend to drop a lot quickly. 2 years of negative return, and you will likely be significantly below unlevered portfolio. They also suffer in sideway (or even a slightly positive) markets from fees, cost of leverage and daily compounding which can hurt in sideways market. In contrast, they do well in a steadily rising market. 15+ years isn't enough of a timeline because UPRO and SSO can drop more than 50%+ in their max drawdowns, and take years to come back to original principal. I don't know anyone who wouldn't rethink their strategy after losing 50% of principal. Tracking error is another issue whereby the fund you purchase doesn't track correctly. Not sure how well they track, but at a portfolio level, this will become an issue as daily rebalancing is not practical for most investors.

That said, there is a lot to be said for utilizing leverage to construct a more diversified portfolio. The link above utilizes TMF (3x LT treasury). Despite the title of that thread, it's certainly not anything close to ""risk-parity."" When you construct a portfolio with 3x S&P500 and 3x LT Treasury, you are betting that stocks will go up and rates go lower, and the opposite not happen. Should inflation come back (leading to increase in rates), this strategy can seriously backfire. After the last 10 years, many believe that equity valuations are quite high, and expect future equity returns to be subpar. If you believe this, leveraging equity may not make sense. I have no answers to this one, but also important is the relationship between equity and bonds going forward, particularly given the low global interest rate environment we are in today.

It's also important to understand that you should be looking at leverage from the portfolio perspective. In short, it doesn't matter if you obtain 200% leverage from SSO, from credit card or mortgage, from futures, etc. The net result in theory is identical regardless of where leverage comes from, but in practice, collateral requirements, borrowing terms, margin call, and all other important technicalities are different. For example, it wouldn't make sense to take a loan from a high APR credit card vs. futures market where you can obtain low cost leverage. Execution matters in this strategy. Another consequence is that - if you hold cash and SSO - it's akin to delevering from 2.0x leverage. It's not a hands-off strategy, as you need to rebalance to keep your portfolio-level leverage in check.

I also don't think the right amount of leverage is 300%. The right amount of leverage would depend on the actual portfolio, and we can only say so in hindsight.",1580079955.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/eue4x3/why_not_have_a_big_chunk_in_leveraged_etfs/ffooizk/

The point is that in the past 20 years we've had a huge bull market which has included a few market crashes and a huge run up overall. It's a fairly reasonable expectation that the next 50 or so years will feature crashes and bull runs (best case scenario for you). and, when that happens, leverage underperforms due to beta slipage and rebalncing costs.

He's right, you're wrong, including when ER is taking into account. Your chart had continuing deposits every year for 20 years of the amount of the initial deposit. Obviously if you keep adding double to the initial investment into the biggest recovering and longest bull run in the history of the stock market, then leverage will out perform. 

Imagine if the stock market went up a ton like it did over the past 20 years but it started with a 10 year steady bull run and then ended with a few crashes. Leverage would also underperform in that case too. 

These are clear, rational arguments. The main idea is that: the market has been really good these past 20 years. AT BEST you should expect something like that in the future --- huge bull runs with a few crashes.

What is true is that if you have a market crash, followed literally by the *longest bull market in history*, your 2x fund does pretty well (as long as you don’t mind losing 82% of your hard-earned money in a crash).

What’s not true is considering the longest bull market in the history of ever to be part of a “worst case scenario”.  That is ludicrous.  It is obviously part of an absolutely best case scenario.

Also, your analysis is faulty.  From their lows in 2009, the S&P 500 went up 200% in the next 7 years which allowed the 2x to catch back up.  This is not 6% a year as you claim, it is 16% a year, an unrealistically high return to consider “worst case”.

Overall, 2x funds have done surprisingly well, and have proven that the warnings about them not being suitable as a long term holding were overblown.  That said, you’ve overstated the case.

These are the take home messages. (Keep in mind this is for 30-year roth investment)  PLEASE correct me if I'm wrong on anything:

- If we take into account scenarios like those that have played in in the past 50 years, 2x leveraged ETFs like SSO have typically underpformed the S&P 500. For instance, if you invested in 1999 and held during the 2000 and 2008 crashes AND through the huge bull market until today, SSO way underperformed SPY. 

- There are no ways to buy things that reliabliy magnifiy the S&P 500 for the long run that don't require at least quaterly maintance

Those two statements are arguablly inconsistent (i.e. they both can't be true). 

Can you give me an argument for why the first statement is true? Let's say we're doing a 25 year projection in the future. 

I think it's very reasonable to expect in the next 25 years two huge market crashes plus a very long bull run. Even if we grant that (and in that order, where the bull run proceeds the 2 crashes), then a 2x levered index does not make sense. Here's the graph justifying this:

Appreciate the reply. I'm just trying to learn more. 

I guess I'm focusing on SSO here, which is far as I can tell is somewhat of a benchark for 2x leveraged indexes from a top company. 

If volatility drag was a major concern for long term investments in volatile markets, then wouldn't you see that diminish the returns in simple charts of these ETFS?

If you google SSO ETF and VOO ETF and compare the charts based on percentages, you'll see that since it's inception on June 23 2006, SSO has gone up 341%. If you look at VOO from June 23 2006 to today you get 168. That's within 5% of matching 2x.

The explanation for WHY volitlity drag doesn't make an effect long, long term, is the whole purpose of this post (see the math above).

Should have put 1.5x so $100 trading with $150. To be margin called (all assets liquidated to cover borrowed money) your account value or security you are buying on margin would have to fall to the borrowed amount. In this case your total amount invested is $150 and borrowed amount is $50 so if the value dropped to $50 (50/150= 33%, 100%-33%= 67% loss before call). With 1.8x leverage you would need a 55% loss to be called. While 55%+ losses have happened, it’s extremely unlikely that happens from any random point in time you chose to invest. If you want to be even safer you can wait til the market is off an ATH and calculate what the market would have to drop from its ATH if that makes sense.

Like if the market was already 50% down from ath you could leverage 2x (margin call at 50% loss), for it to happen in this case the market would have to drop a total of 75% from its previous ath which is unheard of. 

Also so much easier to project future gains. You will get the market return x leverage - cost of debt. With 3% costs, a long time horizon will almost certainly beat the cost.

LETF,Investing,enr9xg,"Yale economists argue that ""the most financially responsible"" long-term investment is a leveraged index. Article in description. What do you think?",fe4ndpw,"I personally follow this strategy. So far it’s been easy (stocks always go up!) but before I implemented it I went and back tested around 2008 and found it would have been painful but tolerable. My max draw down would have been about 60% but it recovered within a year. Even a 1987 or 1929 like event would be livable as long as you sell off on the way down and buy back in on the way up.

I modeled all the transaction fees from my broker and if I sell off whenever my leverage gets above 2.1 and buy back in whenever it gets below 1.9 the risk of getting a margin call is minimal and the transaction fees aren’t that bad. It seems a little counter intuitive because you end up selling low and buying high but as long as the market is positive long term it works out.

The real risk is if interest rates go up significantly during a downturn but as long as the Fed keeps doing their thing I view that as acceptable.

I’m also considering bracketing my position by selling a call above the expected movement over a month and buying a put at my rebalance price. This would minimize my pain in a serious downturn and have only limited impact on my upside. I’d probably do it for enough value to cover half my portfolio.",1578861096.0,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/enr9xg/yale_economists_argue_that_the_most_financially/fe4ndpw/

LETF,Investing,enr9xg,"Yale economists argue that ""the most financially responsible"" long-term investment is a leveraged index. Article in description. What do you think?",fe46n6r,"I agree with the article. 

Leverage, when applied correctly can greatly shape the form of ones return. An example is running TQQQ/TECL in a portfolio. These have incredible CAGRs, but come at the trade off of incredible drawdowns. 

The human element is what prevents people from taking on leverage. Many people fixate on one “silver bullet” and so they try out a product like TQQQ. However, when that product starts to drop in value, our minds attempt to shy away from the loss and we end up selling at the worst possible time. 

Risk tolerance is captured at an individual level and no two investors will feel the same. I personally enjoy and continue to use leverage in my strategies. I would say that if you’re young and have the ability to generate new capital (to keep infusing your portfolio), then leverage may be worth looking into.

The thing that folks tend to forget with leverage is that even if you happen to be unlucky and get a 50% drawdown in a year, your portfolio likely still has more money in it than if you simply invested in the index.

To prove this, consider UPRO vs VTI. UPRO is leveraged 3x.

https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2019&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=false&reinvestDividends=true&benchmark=VFINX&symbol1=UPRO&allocation1_1=100


Consider that a $10,000 investment in UPRO turns into $171,000, while that same investment (non leveraged) only turns into $35,000 if using just VTI. 

Now, if the index dropped 50% over the course of the next year, that $35,000 in VTI would be reduced to $17,500. Whereas, your UPRO would be reduced as well, but it likely would still end up at a higher dollar figure than the VTI investor (with UPRO, you will only get “wiped out” if the S&P experiences a 34%++ drop in one single day... which is highly unlikely to say the least). This is due to the daily leverage reset on UPRO. 

As with anything, do your due diligence before jumping in. Read the prospectuses of the funds. Understand  the risks and trade offs.",1578856252.0,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/enr9xg/yale_economists_argue_that_the_most_financially/fe46n6r/

LETF,Investing,enr9xg,"Yale economists argue that ""the most financially responsible"" long-term investment is a leveraged index. Article in description. What do you think?",fe6l5vx,"I have a few problems with this paper. 

The first is their retrospective use of the US market as the basis for their thinking. This is the very most successful of the hundreds of markets active over the relevant time. This represents a massive **hindsight bias**. Who can claim with confidence to pick the most successful market over the next 50 years?

Second leverage increases your risk of being wiped out. Anyone employing significant leverage across the great depression would have been wiped out. [They claim otherwise but this is because they ignore margin calls and assume you can easily adjust your holdings on the way down.] The reality is that such a person would have exited the market probably for many years, as did most people at the time. They did not have the data from the future to show that that was a bad idea.

Third it is meaningless to talk about average returns. What matters is the distribution. If you are wiped out and there is high unemployment you are up the creek. It does not matter that in an alternate universe you might have been able to buy an extra Ferrari.

Having said that I think there is some merit in young people using leverage, provided they are confident that they will remain employed in a downturn and thus able to replenish the coffers.

LETF,Investing,enr9xg,"Yale economists argue that ""the most financially responsible"" long-term investment is a leveraged index. Article in description. What do you think?",fe61nhj,"SSO is the ticker symbol for a daily-leveraged Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). Specifically (ignoring fees), SSO returns 2 times the daily return of the S&P 500 index (which is tracked by ETFs such as SPY, VOO). So if SPY goes up 1% for the day, SSO goes up 2%. The same goes for negative returns, of course.



Some ~~FOOLS~~ conservative people think that buying and holding *daily*-leveraged ETFs is foolish, because your money will gradually decay away due to ""beta slippage"" (which is just fancy jargon used to denote geometric compounding, as far as I can surmise). Those people might be right, when it comes to leveraged commodities: If an underlying asset goes up 10% one day, and falls 10% the next day, then an investment in that asset would have lost 1% cumulatively (0.9 * 1.1 = 0.99), whereas the leveraged fund would have lost 4% (0.8 * 1.2 = 0.96).

This argument could apply to *all* risky investments though, leveraged or not. What it fails to account for is long term price drift. The S&P tends to grow in the long run (that's why it's viewed as a smart investment). So while SSO & UPRO (3x daily leverage) magnify the random day-to-day fluctuations in SPY, they can also magnify and compound its long-term upwards drift. There still is such a thing as too much leverage though; it's sort of a question of how the underlying asset's expected daily return compares with it's variance, and your personal risk tolerance.



Last thing: leveraged ETFs are distinct from margin investing, which I believe is what OPs link actually referred to. The idea there is that you take out a loan on the assets in your portfolio, which you can use to invest more. If the return on your investments is greater than the interest rate of the loan (which can vary widely by brokerage btw), then you've made money by ""leveraging"" your portfolio - increasing your money's exposure to the market. This can be risky, of course, but in some sense that's kind of the point.

This was certainly a longer response than it needed to be, but hopefully it's helpful... Cheers!",1578879776.0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/enr9xg/yale_economists_argue_that_the_most_financially/fe61nhj/

LETF,Investing,ea6qe9,Leveraged ETFs (TQQQ) - sanity check,fao5fza,"If the index goes up 1%, TQQQ goes up 3%. So to keep it simple, say TQQQ is at 100. TQQQ then becomes 3%. 

Say the index goes down 1%. Then TQQQ goes down 3% to 99.91. 

See how loses are amplified? 

So this occurs on a daily basis. So just because the index went up x% over a 3 month period (or whatever) doesn’t mean that the 3 times leveraged ETF went up by 3x% over the same period. The leveraging occurs daily. So as the index moves up and down, the downward movements always offset the upwards movements (as I showed in my example). So volatility is a 3 times ETF’s biggest enemy. And the longer you hold it, the worse it is since you’re exposed to more volatility.


As for your question specifically, if the index goes up (and ups out gain downs in the market) then TQQQ will be net positive (ie. the positive gains you observed). Look at the number or green days vs red days over each of those time spans and you’ll see what I mean. 

As soon as the number of red days out weigh green days (or the magnitude of the market going down is greater then going up and a day to day basis),TQQQ will have a times greater time recovering, since it’s gone down 3 times more.",1576257649.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ea6qe9/leveraged_etfs_tqqq_sanity_check/fao5fza/

Whether you contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA will depend on your current income level.  You're young, so you're probably not making much money yet - which means you can expect your tax rate in retirement to be higher than it is now - which would make Roth the better option.

LETF,ETFs,1nwvplq,Thoughts on UPRO? For long term hold,nhjn3xu,"Pros unbeatable returns when the S&P500 is on a bull run. Cons over 90% drawdowns and medical bills from the whiplash of the volatility. 

It probably does not have a place in most portfolios. 

It’s best use, in my opinion, is to efficiently reach a desired amount of leverage particularly to implement alt strategies or bonds/fixed income. For example, you could run 100% equity (or a beta of 1) allocating 20% UPRO and 40% to other equities while still having enough cash leftover for 40% bonds or trend following etc. Volatility will still be high but that’s a simple example of how it could be used in a portfolio with long investment horizon. I’d prefer if the levered component could be spread across US/ExUS for this approach which would mildly reduce the volatility coming from that sleeve of the portfolio. 

I personally use a different route and use portable alpha funds like AQR fusion to leverage my portfolio but you have to eat large fees and have less control on the allocations. However, this approach can reach similar amounts of leverage as above while increasing the total returns without driving the overall volatility of the portfolio up to stomach turning levels. 

Both of the above approaches to leverage are safer than the relatively expensive margin rates available on the big brokerage sites and won’t be margin called.",1759499114.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1nwvplq/thoughts_on_upro_for_long_term_hold/nhjn3xu/

LETF,ETFs,1mha6yn,Opinions on TQQQ,n6wi6a9,"> ehhh except who just puts 10k into a investment and lets it ride 25 years with no additions.

Two things here:

1. Plenty of people do. That's a fairly normal thing to do in the event that you sell a house, get an inheritance, or some other way acquire a large lump sum of money all at once.

2. Even if no one did that, your information here would be entirely irrelevant for the purpose of determining your investment decisions. A backtest with additional contributions over time doesn't tell you more information about the general performance of a particular asset compared to a backtest without additional contributions. All that's doing is giving more weight to whatever happened most recently in time. If the most recent set of events was a bull market, it will make all the contributions before the bull market look better - by contrast, if the most recent set of events was a bear market it will make all the contributions before the bear market look much worse.

So all a DCA backtest shows me is that the last 15 years have been a bull market - which we already knew. It doesn't give us better information about how TQQQ can be expected to perform (with or without additional contributions).

I think this confuses people because a lot of people think DCA is a risk mitigation strategy. In reality it is not.",1754327468.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1mha6yn/opinions_on_tqqq/n6wi6a9/

Therefore it usually takes more positive days to make up for the negative days. Buying and holding a leveraged ETF during periods of high volatility or bear markets will hurt more than they'll help.

For example, a stock is trading at 500 and drops 10% to 450. The next day it rises by 10%, but now that's 10% of 450 so were at 495.

> This ProShares ETF seeks **daily investment results** that correspond, before fees and expenses, to 3x **the daily performance** of its underlying benchmark **(the “Daily Target”).**

> While the Fund has a **daily investment objective,** you may hold Fund shares for longer than **one day** if you believe it is consistent with your goals and risk tolerance.

> For any holding period other than **a day,** your return may be higher or lower than **the Daily Target.** These differences may be significant. Smaller index gains/losses and higher index volatility contribute to returns worse than **the Daily Target.** Larger index gains/losses and lower index volatility contribute to returns better than **the Daily Target.**

> The more extreme these factors are, the more they occur together, and the longer your holding period while these factors apply, the more your return will tend to deviate. Investors should consider periodically monitoring their geared fund investments in light of their goals and risk tolerance.

One year later, there's a correction and its share price is $75. No problem - we're buy and hold investors!

Not what you were hoping for, but not bad! 


Now let's leverage this scenario. The correction happens and your $100 investment is worth $25. No big deal, we're buy-and-hold investors, and this correction happened early in the game when it has the least impact. At the end of the bull run, you now have $92.82.

Your leveraged investment is down to $37.13 and at the end of next year is worth $48.27. You pray that the bull market lasts until at least the end of year 11 when you have finally made your money back.

LETF,ETFs,1imkbcc,How are TQQQ dividends taxed?,mc3cuir,"Just check the tax document and it should spill it out as to which is qualified and unqualified. From there, it just depends on your tax bracket after you factor in the below parameters:

Here’s the basic breakdown of how each type of dividend is taxed:

Qualified Dividends:
These are dividends from stocks or ETFs that meet specific IRS requirements, such as being paid by a U.S. corporation or a qualified foreign corporation, and the investor must meet a holding period requirement (usually holding the stock for at least 60 days during the 121-day period surrounding the dividend).
Tax Rate: For long-term capital gains, qualified dividends are taxed at favorable rates of 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your income level. (The IRS will use your taxable income to determine the appropriate tax rate.)

Non-Qualified (Unqualified) Dividends:
These dividends don’t meet the IRS requirements to be considered “qualified” and may be paid by a foreign company or due to some other reason. In the case of TQQQ, these may include dividends from securities or positions that are leveraged or shorted, which usually don’t qualify for favorable tax rates.
Tax Rate: Non-qualified dividends are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate, which can be as high as 37% for the highest earners in 2025.",1739231040.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1imkbcc/how_are_tqqq_dividends_taxed/mc3cuir/

While BRK.B is OK to hold if you believe in outperformance of Warren Buffet, QQQM is NOT. All the stocks in QQQM are already in VOO, so you’re simply double-dipping.

Please learn about TQQQ & leveraged ETFs in detail before you blow off your money to kingdom come. TQQQ is NOT meant to be a long term passive Hold like VOO as they’re fundamentally different ETFs because it has daily leverage resetting strategy, time decay and extreme volatility. If Market dips by 2-3%, TQQQ nose bleeds and melts over -10%, imagine what it would do if the Market were to actually go into correction of -20% to -30%.

XMMO is a good pair with VOO because it focuses on Momentum within Mid Cap stocks and has 0% overlap too. On the other hand, SPMO is just VOO but consolidated to 100 holdings and is top heavy into same stocks as VOO, so no point in reinvesting into same stocks.

The problem with leveraging is a single drawdown can reduce your balance to almost zero. We're talking about a 98% drawdown! It then takes decades to recover from that.

If time it right get in and out at the right time, and it's a bull market, you can make money, but if not, you could lose almost all of it.

LETF,ETFs,1hpbize,Newbie seeking advice ,m4gcv75,"Please do yourself a major favour and stay away from leveraged ETFs like TQQQ. 

It is NOT meant to be a long-term hold that you can simply DCA into and become a millionaire overnight or in a few years. That’s NOT how TQQQ or any other leveraged ETFs works. They are reset daily, have a time decay phenomenon, experience extreme volatility and have negative growth during drawdowns. You may even go into negative in-case of a worst case scenario. If you are not a day trader and daily risk taker, then its not worth it at all.

QQQ is just another performance chasing ETF that de-diversifies your portfolio instead by concentrating you into the same Top 10 or so holdings of VOO. Ignore it altogether.

Just go with VOO & chill if you like to be only invested into US. However, below suggested portfolio can also work for you as it has better risk-adjusted returns and global diversification:

VOO: 60%

AVUV: 20%

VXUS or DFIV: 20%

LETF,ETFs,1h78emz,Any recommendations??,m0jl778,"If your risk appetite is high, then a 100% equities portfolio will be best-suited for your needs. The funds you have selected have a massive overlap and doesn’t give you any diversification as such but rather concentrate your holdings further into an already concentrated S&P 500. 

Do you know how TQQQ works? The daily resetting of leverage? Time-Decay? Drawdown and Pullback multiplier on TQQQ? If your answer is NO to any or all of these questions, then completely discard TQQQ. It is meant for day-traders and not long-term passive investors.

Don’t chase past performance by investing into Thematic ETFs like QQQM, SMH, SCHG, VUG, VGT, XLK, FTEC, etc. as they introduce uncompensated risk and will drag your portfolio further down as compared to the Market during corrections, pullbacks and actual Bear Markets.

An ideal allocation for you, if you want a 100% equities portfolio that is globally-diversified and has best risk-adjusted returns would be as per below:

US: VOO or VTI @ 40%

US Small Cap Value: AVUV @ 20%

International Developed: VEA or IEFA @ 30%

Emerging Markets: VWO or IEMG @ 10%

You can even use an asset allocation ETF like VT or URTH which essentially invests in equities across the globe and rebalance too on your behalf, usually annually. So all you have to do is invest via DCA or Lump Sum & Chill for 30 years or whenever you decide to retire.

Alternatively, you can choose to have some fun as well with 2-5% of your portfolio by investing in BTC. Even if you were to lose entirety of 2-5%, then atleast 95% of your portfolio is safe and will continue to produce 6-8% (conservatively) or even more CAGR over a 30 year period. Since you’ve already got 30% BTC, then HODL it but don’t add more into it. This will massively overweight your portfolio anyway if you have atleast $10K invested. If BTC were to go Mars, not even Moon, then the gains will eclipse the total returns of the ETF portfolio which I suggested above.

Note: This is simply a suggestion. I am not a financial advisor nor have any personal interests vested in iShares or Vanguard. Please do your own due dilligence and necessary research before investing money into the stock market.

The government continues to debase USD through a variety  of ways (i.e, inflation, Fed printing, etc.).  The purchasing power of USD has been declining for over 100 years and especially since it was taken off the gold standard in 1971.  Note that the government has changed how  the consumer price index (CPI) is defined and calculated dozens of times since inceptions which objectively has understated its current effects on decreasing purchasing power.  Additionally,  the government (us, the taxpayers) pays large amounts of money to pay CPI-linked adjustments in TIPS, I bonds, and Social Security benefits. There is a clear conflict of interest in understating the CPI due to the fact that the government also calculates CPI stats.  Quite literally, if you used previous definitions/calculations, CPI would be much higher.

In any event, poor government monetary policy will continue to debase USD.  Here are some data points to consider:

Chasing past performance implies to investing and overweighting in expensive US securities that have performed exceptionally in the recent past 12-14 years or so of continuous Bull Run while ignoring other inexpensive securities from Developed and Emerging Markets which are generating lower CAGR. This is based on PE ratios.

Additionally, 2008 was a black swan event that won’t repeat every 10-12 years. However a similar magnitude of correction may always materialize due to many other reasons. Hence, a correction of crash of upto 40-60% may get repeated again but would it be because of a similar event like 2008? Maybe or Maybe not.

2. Youre right. Leveraging a diversified portfolio with uncorrelated assets is a fantastic idea and historically has done very well. It makes a ton of sense to take a boglehead 60/40 portfolio and leverage it. Even better, dump the shitty short term and corpo bonds in BND and just use long term treasuries to hedge the equities. 

For 2x leverage, dont leverage the bonds. Just buy very long duration funds, like ZROZ or GOVZ, instead of 2x TLT which is UBT. Its just better to use long duration vs levered shorter long like TLT.

3. Skip SSO frankly, just use UPRO and up your allocation to treasuries or whatever else your investing in, like international or small cap value or managed futures (big brain, CTA and KMLM)",1732667884.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1h0ra6r/why_not_2x/lz60c62/

I moved my IRA to a default allocation of 40% SSO, 60% VOO in late Jan, 2022. I did so expecting a long period of red, with eyes on acquisition and rebalancing, to benefit from the recovery. I’m beating the index meaningfully since then (more than 15% from the start) despite giving the index a running head start. 

The greatest real danger with leveraged index funds is psychology. Imagine the feeling of holding SSO, UPRO, or TQQQ through that 8 week decline. When you’re in it, things feel like they’re not going to turn around… and you’re doubling or tripling index downside. For two months straight. Even if you’re disciplined, that’s not fun.

LETF,ETFs,1gu4dx4,I'm 21 and just put pretty much all my savings into these 4 ETFs. Plz tell me it was a good idea lol,lxr5b5a,"I would be cautious about all of them but VOO. 

UPRO - leveraged ETFs perform great under the proper conditions. They're not really meant to be long term investments though. Haven't looked at the one for UPRO but the prospectus for others usually state that the ticker is a risky vehicle and explains why. Leveraged stuff long term works if you are VERY lucky. We just had the longest bull run in US history. Are you feeling lucky about it continuing? Just give it some thought and do some reading in the ETF prospectus(you can find it on their website).

NANC/KRUZ - potentially a gimmick ETF and although it has performed decently since inception the methodology is a flawed one. We know that politicians can outperform because they have inside information(Marjorie Taylor Greene still underperformed the market, I am happy to say) but their disclosures come after purchases are made, sometimes quite a bit afterwards. If the momentum of a good pick keeps going - good. If it doesn't, you're basically buying the top. And if it's a bad pick... well imagine underperforming ol' Marge. 

VOO is a very good pick and while I personally recommend VTI over it for new investors since it has small cap exposure it is still a very good ETF with a solid track record and very low fees.",1731937131.0,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1gu4dx4/im_21_and_just_put_pretty_much_all_my_savings/lxr5b5a/

While VOO is solid as your core holding, I'd strongly suggest reducing the speculative ETFs and adding some international exposure through something like VXUS. 

If you're keen on keeping some spice in your portfolio, consider limiting the thematic ETFs to 20-40% max and building a core position in low-cost broad market funds.",1731938273.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1gu4dx4/im_21_and_just_put_pretty_much_all_my_savings/lxr88el/
LETF,ETFs,1gu4dx4,I'm 21 and just put pretty much all my savings into these 4 ETFs. Plz tell me it was a good idea lol,lxu1yq5,"What? Ditch upro, nanc, and kruz. Add QQQM and an etf that is mid/small cap, something like VXF.

Why? As mentioned Upro is a geared vehicle and as such is subject to beta decay, laymen’s terms… the bad will outweigh the good over a full market cycle due to compounding. The political gimmick ETFs are expensive and as mentioned have delayed data.

Source? I wholesale ETFs, mutual funds, and other vehicles to financial advisors for a living.

Why QQQM and VXF? 95% of your return is coming from your broad allocation decisions. 5% from a blend of market timing and security selection. QQQM and VXF will diversify your holdings and tap into areas of the market that aren’t accessed via VOO.

Also, dollar cost average, every week 50% of $100 (or whatever you can afford) goes into voo, 25% into VXF, 25% in QQQM. Don’t pay attention to headlines or pricing, just always do this.

Lastly as mentioned, emergency fund before you invest! 100% the best takeaway!

You’re right to think that it makes more sense to take risk in a tax advantaged account and when you have a longer investment horizon, but I think you’re missing an important piece. Compensated risk vs uncompensated risk. Ask yourself, what drives market returns? If you don’t know then do some research on CAPM theory and the Fama and French 5 factor model. This will help you build a blueprint on how to increase compensated risk.

Until then I’d recommend going more agnostic in your investment strategy by investing in either a TDF or VT.",1731648805.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1grmtv6/20_yo_looking_to_start_investing_during_internship/lx7vdyk/

It *can* help with recovering faster. It does in the context of this particular backtest because of the epic bull run for the last 15 years. But there is no reason to assume that the next ""lost decade"" will be followed by a 15 year bull. Just because that happened last time, it doesn't mean that will happen *next* time.

As I've said before, with both leveraged and non-leveraged ETFs, DCA isn't actually a risk mitigation strategy. It reduces the risk of a crash immediately after investment, but increases the problems you face if you have a crash after investing for several months/years/decades. DCA does not reduce your risk, it only delays it! That's not going to show up on the backtest because of the aforementioned 15 year bull market....

Again, the actual way to mitigate your risk with leveraged ETFs is by hedging with uncorrelated assets like long treasuries and managed futures. I would also suggest a more diversified equities position by using UPRO instead of TQQQ.",1728339033.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1fy8u4t/why_did_i_not_know_about_etfs/lqujmjn/

(2) the market does not care at what interval you invest. DCA doesn't necessarily help you recover faster.

Not really, no. It only looks that way because of the epic bull market we've been in for the last 15 years. Consider this backtest of the SP500 *with DCA* backtested [from 1885 - 2010](https://testfol.io/?d=eJytj8FKw0AQhl8lzKGnVDYNCg0UL9aTSFAvRUoYs7Nx63a3TtZUCXl3Jw0ieOjJ287Ot%2F%2F%2FbQ%2BNCy%2FoSmTct1D00EbkWGmMBAVACuT1z7RQajnPFvM8k%2FuJ69BBkSmlUkC9q6w3DqMNHgqDrqUUamxfjQvHE%2FU7VobpXSI3hOy%2BJI6Dc9Y31dF6PdJXakjhEDia4GwQs%2BcePO5HjcdZmVwqJY%2Bs76iNN7azWjQFivwhnUzyI%2FQ13U4l98GT0NHWb8RT1HQew8rN04MsD8Q1%2BXjSHLYpaMYGCpH4W5t8Jvk%2FVl%2FfrfLZeqUulmcktsM312mIzQ%3D%3D).

As with regular ETFs, DCA isn't actually a strategy to mitigate risk. It just delays risk. It's fundamentally an emotional strategy to mitigate behavioral risks - but mathematically it won't necessarily help you in the long run.

SSO is probably the most sensible of all of these. 

> There's also ones like RSSB or NTSX I would say are pretty safe, even for buying and holding.

Yes, agreed.

Or a strategy like HFEA or HFEA + managed futures is also appropriate for buying and holding because hedges will actually mitigate risk (unlike DCA).

The truth about leveraged ETFs is that they tend to go down more than the daily leverage in bear markets and they tend to go up more than the daily leverage in bull markets. This is due to the compounding effect that the daily leverage has, and the fact that bull markets have way more green days and bear markets have way more red days.

LETF,ETFs,1ffjnif,Leveraged ETF strategy to protect downside risk,lmwmyqb,"Well, but you made it seem as if you were going to need the money in a year.

If you have long term goals you can use leverage to increase diversification which would be more optimal long term. I personally would not have a 100% QQQ portfolio. QQQ has done exceptionally well in the last ten years or so, but the last time something happened it had a 80% plus crash. 

According to modern portfolio theory, the right way to use leverage is finding the most optimal portfolio (highest expected returns relative to the risk you’re taking) and then leverage it up. The most optimal portfolio is impossible to find, but the point is that you should hold a broadly diversified portfolio and then increase its risk through leverage. 

If you do that, you’re due to have higher returns for the same risk if you’re investing for the long term.

Different assets perform best under different economic conditions. The last 15 years have been great for stocks so they’ve crushed everything else. There are other regimes when other assets crush stocks. 

In summary, stocks do well during times of economic growth with no inflation shocks. Fixed income do well in times of deflation or economic stagnation with low inflation. Trend following managed futures strategies do best in times of change (like inflation shocks) and are more or less flat during other regimes. Commodities also kind of work during inflation shocks but they’re a drag during every other market condition, so it’s probably better to invest in them through trend following or carry strategies.

Managed futures are strategies that trade future contracts. These are contracts where you agree to sell or buy an asset for a set price in a future date. These contracts can be bought or sold through an exchange and constantly change in price. They’re used for leverage (instead of taking a loan and buying the asset, you agree to buy it in the future which exposes you to the price increase or decrease in said asset without having bought it) and for risk transfer (you can enter a contract hoping to be compensated for taking the risk of a change in the price of the underlying asset).

Managed futures mainly use trend following (time series momentum, in academic language) to take long or short positions in futures.

These strategies are generally uncorrelated to stocks and bonds, though they can all crash together if there’s a liquidity crisis in the market. Trend following needs a trend to develop so it can’t avoid a very sudden crash. However, if there’s a prolonged bear market after the crash, they should thrive through shorting everything that’s doing badly.

Instead of falling into FOMO and recency bias, you can use leverage to create a stocks/bonds/managed futures, which are generally uncorrelated assets. If you’re thinking for the long term and you want to use leverage, that’s a better idea than going all in QQQ. 

Be prepared for your portfolio to behave differently to the S&P 500 and having long periods of underperformance, though. That it should work better long term doesn’t mean that it will do better every year. It will have lower drawdowns, which will let you keep compounding.

* **Potential for Outperformance**: Equal-weight strategies give each stock in the index an equal share, regardless of market capitalization. This approach often leads to better performance during periods when smaller or undervalued stocks outperform the market’s giants. However, equal-weighted funds tend to have higher transaction costs and are less liquid due to lower AUM and inflows.
* **Underutilization**: If equal-weighted indices had more AUM and inflows than their market cap-weighted counterparts, the dynamics could shift. With more investors buying into equal-weighted strategies, the increased demand could lead to higher prices for the smaller companies in the index, potentially driving superior performance. Essentially, the strategy that attracts more inflows and AUM often sees a reinforcing cycle of performance due to the flow of capital.",1724173563.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1ewew3h/chatgpt_puts_it_all_perfectly/lj2icfp/
LETF,ETFs,1ewew3h,CHATGPT puts it all perfectly.,lj39ejf,"strongman personal finance and his idea of global stocks is extremely stupid as other stock markets dont have the foundational aspects of the US stock market that had driven them up so much higher than international and continue to do so (401k/roth ira, home of tech stocks, massive interest in stocks, and so forth)

You've made some compelling points about why the U.S. stock market has consistently outperformed many international markets and why focusing on global stocks might not be as beneficial as investing in U.S. markets, particularly for the reasons you've outlined. Let’s explore these arguments in more depth:

# 5. Conclusion:

* **The Strength of U.S. Markets**: The U.S. stock market is fundamentally strong due to the massive inflows from retirement accounts, its status as the home of the world’s leading tech companies, and the broad interest and participation in equities by American investors. These factors create a robust, innovative, and stable market that is likely to continue outperforming international markets.
* **Global Stocks vs. U.S. Focus**: While some exposure to international markets can provide diversification benefits, a heavy focus on global stocks, as advocated by some, might not be the most effective strategy. Given the unique advantages of the U.S. market, concentrating on U.S. stocks—particularly those in the tech sector—may offer better long-term returns.
* **Investment Strategy**: For investors seeking to maximize returns, a strong case can be made for prioritizing U.S. stocks, given the unique factors that support their growth. While international stocks can play a role in a diversified portfolio, the U.S. market’s strengths make it an attractive focal point for long-term investment strategies.

In summary, while investing in global stocks has its merits, the foundational strengths of the U.S. stock market, including its robust retirement system, tech leadership, and strong investor participation, make it a superior choice for many investors. The consistent outperformance of the U.S. market, driven by these factors, suggests that a U.S.-focused investment strategy may be more effective than a broader global approach.",1724181912.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1ewew3h/chatgpt_puts_it_all_perfectly/lj39ejf/

LETF,ETFs,1edxzky,"If index tracking ETFs are good, aren't leveraged version strictly better?",lfc1ff1,"The issue is decay in leveraged ETFs which drags long term returns down. If you have a 3x leveraged ETFs, you get 3x the gain but also 3x the losses. That sounds fine, except that if the value drops, say, 30% (from to 0.7) it has to go up 43% to break even. 


As long as the ETF strictly goes up, this isn't a problem.. but since they don't, this is an issue. Consider an index that has an annualized return of 9.1%. With a 3x leveraged ETF, you'd expect that this would return 27.3% over the year. However, this usually isn't a straight upwards shot, instead you have a bun h of days that are up a little bit and a bunch that are down a bit, averaging out to an upwards trend. 


For instance, of the 250 annual trading days, you could have 130 that go up 1% and 120 that go down 1%. Multiply these out and you get 9.1% gain over the year. But now do this with a leveraged ETF, and you have 130 days up 3% and 120 down 3%. Your return ends up only being 21% for the year, rather than the expected 3x leverage of 27.3%. You are taking 3x the risk/volatility, but in a fairly normal up year, only getting 2.3x the gains. 


Say we have a great year like last year with 20% gains, that might be 100 days up 1%, 100 down 1%, 30 up 2%, and 20 down 2%. Leveraged ETF is up 52%.


Or take a year where the index is basically flat. Say, 126 trading days up 1%, 124 down 1%, for a net annualized gain of 0.8%. With a leveraged ETF this small gain turns into a 5.1% loss. 


Or take a year where the index has a 10.6% loss. 130 days down 1%, 120 days up 1%. 3x leveraged ETF loses 34%. 




Combine this all together now over a decade. Say we have a continuous bull run, up 9.1% a year. Regular ETF returns 138%, 3x leveraged ETF returns 572%. Great, right? Getting well over my 3x leverage. But what if it's not a continuous upwards go...


Instead let's take a decade that has similar overall gains, but is composed of up years and down years. 6 years up 20%, 3 years down 10.6%, one year up 9.1%. Regular ETF returns 133%, leveraged ETF returns 329%. 3x leverage and risk, only 2.5x the gains over a decade. 


Or say we have a modest decade, 5 up years, 3 flat years, 2 down years. The regular ETF returns 27% total over these 10 years. The 3x leveraged ETF overall returns -3.5%. Not good... Turns a gain into a loss.


Or imagine you have a decade that is pretty much flat. 10 years of 0.8% gains annually. Regular ETF is up 8.3% over the decade, leveraged ETF is down 41%. Very bad. 


Tag a flat decade onto a ""fluctuating up decade"", and the regular ETF is up 2.52x over 20 years, the 3x levered ETF is up 2.53x, and you haven't actually gained anything for taking the higher risk. 


Leveraged ETFs make you feel like a genius during sustained single direction bull runs. But during fluctuating markets (which is most markets), they generally underperform in the long run. 


Second issue is that the management expenses are higher for these (they have to pay for their option contracts). SPXL at 3x leverage has an MER of 0.91% for instance vs. VOO at 0.03. So really, I should be subtracting about 0.88% from all of those returns. That, for instance, pushes the ""flat decade"" ETF returns to -46%. 


Third issue is that they generally leverage the capital gains of stocks, but not the dividend yields. So, roughly speaking, if  a 10% up year on the S&P is 8.5% annual capital gain and 1.5% dividends, and a -10% down year is -11.5% capital loss and 1.5% dividends, including the MER issue, 3x leverage looks like nominal 26.12% gains on the upside, and about -33.88% loss on the downside (ignoring volatility decay). All of which means you end up effectively leveraged 2.6x on the upside and 3.4x on the downside. ",1722173601.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1edxzky/if_index_tracking_etfs_are_good_arent_leveraged/lfc1ff1/

LETF,ETFs,1czrerf,Technology heavy ETF portfolio,l5iekis,"Not the person you commented on but a quick inquiry to AI said what is common knowledge on holding tqqq long term. I know you're here to learn, so hopefully this will help:


TQQQ (ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF) is designed for short-term trading and not meant to be held long-term. Here's why:

1. *Leverage*: TQQQ is a leveraged ETF, aiming to provide 300% daily exposure to the NASDAQ-100 Index (QQQ). This amplifies gains, but also increases potential losses.
2. *Compounding*: Due to the daily rebalancing mechanism, TQQQ's returns can deviate significantly from the underlying index over time. This compounding effect can lead to significant losses if held for extended periods.
3. *Volatility*: TQQQ is designed to be traded frequently, taking advantage of short-term market fluctuations. Holding it long-term exposes you to increased volatility and potential drawdowns.
4. *Fees*: TQQQ has a higher expense ratio (0.95%) compared to other ETFs, which can erode returns over time.

If you're looking for long-term exposure to the NASDAQ-100 Index, consider holding the non-leveraged QQQ ETF instead. It's a more suitable option for buy-and-hold investors. Always consult your investment goals, risk tolerance, and financial advisor before making decisions.",1716577135.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1czrerf/technology_heavy_etf_portfolio/l5iekis/

This kind of decay from volatility is part of why the long term returns aren't 3x qqq. When qqq is going up quickly there's a higher return, but it's not proportionate to the increased risk.

LETF,ETFs,1czrerf,Technology heavy ETF portfolio,l5p053m,"Do you know why QQQ is up 15% while TQQQ is down 20% over the same 2+ year span?  The problem is that down markets chop down a 3x leveraged fund so much that it's too low to actually recover.

Example: Fund is at $100, market drops by 20% then there's a 40% rally a couple years later.

$100 * 0.8 * 1.4 = $112 (your up 12%)

Now with a 3x leveraged version of the same fund (TQQQ for example).

$100 * 0.4 * 2.2 = $88 (you're down 12%)

So even after a 40% rally, and with the tracking index up 12%, the 3x leveraged fund still hasn't recovered (12% down). You can see this example with QQQ and TQQQ since end of December 2021. TQQQ still hasn't recovered.

This is why a 3x leveraged investment is great for a bull run, but holding it long term won't work if there's some corrections.

If you believe QQQ is only going up and it won't have a correction in the next 10 years, TQQQ will be a great investment, but a couple corrections and you'll actually be negative, even if QQQ is up at the end of the 10 years.",1716690594.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1czrerf/technology_heavy_etf_portfolio/l5p053m/

LETF,ETFs,1cgvdmt,Move leverage profit to main portfolio,l1yd9zm,"This is a difficult one to simulate. Here is the link to hedgefundies thread in bogleheads. Many many pages about the struggles of accurately simulating leveraged ETFs into the past, before hard data existed. This includes simulating beta slippage and fees.

https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=272007

This ofc was for the HFEA strat which includes levered long treasuries, but the methodology of individually simulating UPRO for the S&P stands.

We are generally confident that holding VT for the long term is fine, even if it crashes soon after buying. We aren't particularly concerned about the path dependence of our returns, and that buying in regularly from the proceeds of our labor income mitigates that risk by averaging prices through time and increasing our exposure to equity.

By not rebalancing into the leveraged ETFs should they drop, you kind of change the intent of what you're doing in my eyes. Buying it and then rebalancing out if the market is up makes sense. It's derisking by de-levering your total equity exposure (you're quasi-1.4x levered while holding 20% in 3x levered ETFs). But when the market is down and the levered position tanks, by letting that whither you're essentially doing the same thing as ""The market is down, I better de-risk"", which is kind of antithetical to the whole idea that when the market is on sale, you buy!

The swing in proportion of levered and unleveled equities changes your relative overall leverage. If the market goes up 10% (ignoring beta slippage and fees for simplicity and assuming the underlying go up equally), the levered portion of your portfolio is now 23% of the portfolio. Now you're more leveraged than before. Same in the opposite direction.

The question is: are you just taking a stab at a lucky run and cashing out if it works, or are you trying to systematically increase exposure to beta since you have a higher risk tolerance? Not rebalancing in when you're low on the levered portion is almost a guarantee that that portion of the portfolio whithers and dies eventually (we see this in the sims of UPRO for 100% buy and hold. Egregiously path dependent and you 100% need luck). You may get great gains out early that juice the portfolio, and the consequences of it dying later are negligible on long term performance, but your risk adjusted performance in that case is abysmal since you took a wild ride for a similar result. Worst case is you piss away 20% of your money and run with your tail between your legs.

Rebalancing from VT to levered equities is probably gonna hurt, since they'll be highly correlated assets. Ideally you'd have a different position that's uncorrelated to rebalance between. Mid or long term treasuries are common like TYD or TMF, some folks use gold but I don't (it's low correlation, but also it's real return is zero on long time frames), some use flat cash positions in a money market core stance which is kinda like holding short term treasuries if you think about where that cash yield comes from.",1714491780.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1cgvdmt/move_leverage_profit_to_main_portfolio/l1yd9zm/

At the time, those assets had a negative correlation close to -0.5 on average. A key fundamental assumption of this strategy that Hedgefundie proposed is that the US will not return to pre-Volcker (pre-1982) monetary policy. That is, we'll be able to significantly mitigate or altogether avoid runaway inflation periods like the late 1970's, during which time bonds suffered greatly.

Hedgie's strategy worked great on paper (at the start) as it was in the middle of a great bull run. What we don't know, and what's impossible to guess is what tomorrow will bring. Bonds have to recover...which of course is possible.

LETF,ETFs,184wgx1,Help understand leveraged ETFs,kb38zd8,"Finally guys I did a lot of reasearch and my conclusion is to stay far away of X3 leverage ETF like TQQQ or SOXL or UPRO.

There is some worse scenarios for those X3 leveraged ETF : that's when you buy at ATH and there is a krack or bear market following : dotcom bubble, october 31 2007, august 30 2018, february 19 2020, november 22 2021 (one of the worst recent bear market).
With leverage X3 like TQQQ or SOXL you re done (game over).

My research are telling me :


It is better to chose a daily QQQ×2 or a daily semiconductors×2 the benefit-risk ratio is the best.
S&P500X2 like SSO ETF sucks , it is better to go longe SMH (X1 no leverage).

The minimal annual growth necessary (CAGR) is around 11% for leverage X3.
For leverage X2 the minimal CAGR goes around 8% .
For the krack of dotcom /october 2007 / august 2018 / february 2020  : USD ETF and QLD ETF will outperformed a lot QQQ and SMH.

For the big krack of 2021 I dont have enough time data we need wait few years again. Nowadays SMH will be +5% / QQQ-2% / USD -14% / QLD -23% / TQQQ -48% / SOXL -64%.

So my strategy will be put 10 to 20% of my portfolio to USD or QLD and hold it long  ( I have a preference in USD when I see the data during krack), when the PE ratio of those fucking semiconductors will go down .
For avoid ATH I only look one thing PE ratio (I tried so many stupid and useless tools in the past).
Is it a  bad strategy?

LETF,ETFs,15id9si,Seeking Feedback on My Portfolio Strategy,jutrps0,">TQQQ: I understand that LETFs may raise eyebrows but I want to spice it up a little.

leveraged products are intended for short-term trading, not long-term holding. read up on 'volatility decay'. TL;DR crashes do huge damage and leveraged crashes are even worse. you need massive, impossible recoveries. if TQQQ crashed 90% you'd need a 1000% gain to break even. 

>I believe the top QQQ companies will dominate the market for the foreseeable future. 

'dominate' in what sense? QQQ crashed 80% from 2000-2002 and needed 14 years to simply break even. https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/QQQ/invesco-qqq/stock-price-history QQQ is based on market cap weighting, so you're buying stocks simply because they're going up not because they're selling more products, have more profits, etc. 

>However, based on backtest 50/50 pairing of these two has a higher return.

(a) backtests don't predict the future. (b) those ETFs have inception dates of 2009 and 2011, meaning neither one has existed through a major bear market lasting several years. SCHG started in 2009 which was the bottom after the 2008 crash. I'd drop SCHG and lean into SCHD, based on the lower valuation and higher dividend yield. 

>Seeing EDV near its historical low intrigues me. Coupled with its history as a reliable hedge

EDV performed very well during the 2008 crash, but crashed hard in 2022 https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EDV/performance?p=EDV long-term bonds have more 'interest rate risk' so I'd recommend either a short-term bond ETF (if the goal is to stabilize the portfolio) or a diversified bond ETF (because there's always a place for bonds).",1691190076.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/15id9si/seeking_feedback_on_my_portfolio_strategy/jutrps0/

Yes EDV crashed in 2022 but if you look at it in the long run it has a higher total return than say BND or AGG. Interest rates cannot go any much higher from here.

LETF,ETFs,15id9si,Seeking Feedback on My Portfolio Strategy,juu8khi,"Somebody already told you however you just did it again. Past performance is a point of view, but you need to understand the drivers of that performance. It's not the only way of see the things. Doing that is like driving looking at rearview mirror. Statistically speaking, the past performance is not best predictor. The return to mean theory states that the greater the deviation of a random variate from its mean, the greater the probability that the next measured variate will deviate less far.

>Interest rates cannot go any much higher from here

You're probably right, however back in the 80's the inflation hit back hardly, so I wouldn't take this for a fact. Also, one thing is fed fund rate, the other is long term interest. Yes, they are related, but it's not 2+2=4. The short term is dictated by the FED and present conditions of the market, like consumption, jobs and inflation are the main drivers. The long term is a little bit tricky. The US debt, for example may keep a pressure in the interest for a while. Many other factors impact on long term interest. It may simply not fall on the amount needed for you to collect the premium in your time horizon. 

It's probably a good time for long term bonds only if you have a exit strategy. If you hold them much past the down cycle of the FED rates and the holdings on the ETF reajust to the new market reality, the upside potential will vanish. Also there's the reinvestment risk: once the interest is lower you win a premium by mark to market variation, them you're going to reinvest that money in way lower yields. 

All that to say the more sensible strategy for the retail investor is to match the bond maturity to the time you'll probably use that money for something.",1691197733.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/15id9si/seeking_feedback_on_my_portfolio_strategy/juu8khi/

[The best companies tend to make the worst stocks and the worst companies as a group tend to make the best stocks](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1540757).

The market is already about 30% tech at this point. Why concentrate in it further? Value has greater expected returns, and the Value spread [is still as wide as it's ever been](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/The-Bubble-Has-Not-Popped).

A rational investor should want to avoid expensive stocks and buy cheap stocks, but this unfortunately isn't how investors' highly-emotional brains work.

The high expectations of these stocks people seem to love are also priced in. Tech stocks would have to *exceed* those already-sky-high expectations to beat the market going forward. Again, look at the insane valuations right now.

LETF,ETFs,10fgskh,Holding TQQQ long term,j4x334r,"Don‘t call it wrong or right, call it suited for a certain scenario and financing situation or not.

Why do you want leveraged ETFs? Normally, to bump exposure up without binding capital (i.e. avoid margin loan). So it‘s a way of financing, ultimately. You gain 3x expo, you save the margin/credit/etc., but you pay basically with two things, maybe three:
(1) higher TER: caused by the synthetic stuff… TER I think 1.8% for TQQQ or so vs. otherwise 0.1% or so on QQQ;
(2) volatility decay. simple to model: simulate a volatile sideways period, e.g. 20 times in a row compare a -2%, then immediately a +2% move in QQQ; do that for TQQQ where then it’s -6%, +6%, respectively. Compare the two, you will see TQQQ drops like a stone, QQQ much less in such a sideways market.
(3) maybe you could add the risk of TQQQ being all futures and leveraged, so counterparty risk is higher in case of a melt-down a la 2007/08 since in such an event paper-products might fail vs. an ETF owning shares. However, to eliminate that you need to dig deep into contracts of ETF to see if you actually own more than paper anyway.

So in short: TQQQ depending on market environment is a more economic or less economic way of financing. Down, volatile, sideways -> leveraged bites you (but also margin loan is dangerous in that case); up -> leveraged ETF is probably an economic way to pay for higher exposure, depending what you would alternatively pay for margin.

LETF,ETFs,10fgskh,Holding TQQQ long term,j51iuwc,"Sure! It's true for all assets. The difference is that TQQQ amplifies the effect.

Very simple illustration for the above mentioned -5%, +5% for two days return (sideways). This leads to:

\- QQQ: initial value say 300 --> PNL=300\*95%\*105%=299.25, so you lose 0.75.

\- TQQQ: you will do 100 (because that then gives you exposure of 300) --> PNL=100\*85%\*115%=97.75, so you lose 2.25.

So same initial one-day exposure to Nasdaq, QQQ leveraged with margin, TQQQ no margin but leveraged in the ETF itself.

It's easy to simulate further out (simple or fancy, depending how well you are in excel/python, etc.). If you do it with -2%, +2%, which is more realistic, you'll barely notice something short-term, but over 1 year your loss more than doubles of the TQQQ with 100 vs. QQQ with 300 initial value.

LETF,ETFs,x5q7al,Guys Help Me Out with Some Differences in certain ETF's and what you would Recommend?,in2n527,">pick some of the best high growth ETF'

you tend to get the best long-term results not with high growth stocks, but with smaller company stocks and 'value' stocks. in technical terms, look up the 'Fama-French Three-Factor Model'. it was created by 2 top finance professors to explain why some stocks perform better than others. the 3 factors are (a) higher risk; (b) smaller companies; and (c) value stocks. 

so if this is a long-term plan, you want to lean towards smaller and 'value' stocks, and away from large and 'growth' stocks. that means check out ETFs like IJH and VIOO, and a little less in VOO/QQQ. 

if you look at the Nasdaq (QQQ) chart going back 20 years, it crashed over 80% in the dot com bubble and didn't break even for 14+ years. most of that red-hot performance is just from the last few years. https://www.macrotrends.net/1320/nasdaq-historical-chart

LETF,ETFs,wr3wqh,"Are we in the ""return to normal"" phase?",ikqgfr2,"It's difficult to say.  I personally would recommend non-leveraged funds given the current volatility.

On the Bearish side:

-Inflation is still hurting consumer sentiment

-Credit card debt is increasing, meaning we might have a debt cycle soon

-Russia's war in Ukraine shows no signs of ending soon

-Several countries including Sri Lanka, India, Brazil, most of Africa, and possibly China are experiencing economic turmoil right now and Europe is pretty much stagnant.

On the Bullish side:

-The market already dropped a lot and may have overcorrected

-Valuations are closer to historical averages

-Unemployment in the US remains low

-Consumer spending remains strong, but has shifted more towards essentials

-Gas prices have decreased

-Inflation has lessened in recent months and the Fed may or may not slow their planned rate hikes

If the war in Ukraine ends, I suspect many of these issues will start to correct themselves.  Inflation will decrease somewhat, especially in foreign countries.  The Fed will then be more comfortable lowering rates again (they almost need to lower rates sooner rather than later given our debt situation).  At this point, stocks will boom again with the cheap money.

Until then, volatility will likely sap any potential gains from leveraged funds.

>I would also assume that it is very likely that the TQQQ fund would have been closed down when its absolute value falls below $1

Why? They could reverse stock split. I think the fact that SQQQ is still available shows they wouldn't delist it. There is still money to be made by selling both TQQQ/SQQQ. But yes, generally, point taken, a 95-99% loss or whatever is pretty much a wipeout and would be uncomfortable.

>absolutely not suitable for long-term ""set-and-forget"" investments

How so? *Some* form of leverage is probably optimal. When it comes to how people actually invest, most DCA over a long period. During a crash they are picking up shares for a very cheap price. Now, does someone have the psychology to keep investing after a 95% drawdown? Who knows, but it would have paid off in the past 20 years.

It also depends on what you mean by set-and-forget I suppose.

LETF,ETFs,tkqhuy,TQQQ Backtest,i1s4wgg,"Valid points. The main thing I wanted to address here was that novice investors (like me) could get the idea that you could just invest a set sum into TQQQ and stomach the volatility, thinking you would get ahead anyway in 20 years. Looking at the past performance of TQQQ, and the performance during and after the short-term Covid crash, I certainly got that idea.

A drawdown of 99.5% from inception and >99.9% from its peak so soon after inception would've been devastating to the basic notion of a triple-leveraged fund.

Additionally, most funds have millions of dollars in annual fixed costs that require a certain amount of income from fees to sustain them. Leveraged funds more so, and even more collateral is required if the fund is performing poorly. The AUM in 2001 and later would've been so small that the sponsor couldn't possibly justify losing money to keep the fund open. If they decided to try operating at a loss for a while after the crash in 2000, the disastrous returns in 2001 and 2002 would've been death blows. By my own calculations, TQQQ returns would've been about -91% in 2000, -88% in 2001, and -85% in 2002. That assumes the current 75 basis point difference in fees between QQQ and TQQQ, which would've been larger due to interest rates back then, so actual returns would've been slightly worse.

And let's not forget 2008! TQQQ doesn't require a tech-focused crash to experience catastrophe. Even though QQQ suffered slightly less than the overall US market, the drawdown for TQQQ would've been >94% from late 2007 to early 2009. It's very notable that TQQQ has yet to live through a single prolonged downturn. So what happens when the next big crash arrives?

I think if there's a drawdown anywhere nearly as bad as 2000-2002, TQQQ would simply be forced to close down for the mechanical reasons above. There would surely be some enthusiastic investors buying the 99.9% dip, but many of those who have a sufficient taste for risk would already be hurting for cash in a downturn like that. In addition, people have gotten far too used to quick recoveries, and the people who bought the dip in 2000 would've been subject to repeated >85% losses in 2001 and 2002. Most people who buy the dip are not ready for that and would've bailed out. On top of everything else, there would be a self-reinforcing fear of TQQQ closing down, leading to reluctance by many to invest. I don't think there would be enough millions ready to rescue TQQQ in the event of a prolonged, >98% crash like that. The pairing with SQQQ is an interesting point but I don't think it negates what I've said here.",1648129920.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/tkqhuy/tqqq_backtest/i1xi56n/

>TY  - JOURAU  - Ginley, MatthewAU  - Scott, DavidAU  - Ensor, KatherinePY  - 2015/01/01SP  - 457EP  - 479N2  - Leveraged Exchange Traded Funds (LETFs) are constructed to provide the indicated leverage multiple of the daily total return on an underlying index. LETFs may perform as expected on a daily basis; however, fund issuers state that there is no guarantee of achieving the multiple of the index return over longer time horizons. LETF returns are extremely volatile and funds frequently un-derperform their target for horizons greater than one month. In this paper, we contribute two nonparametric simulation methods for analyzing LETF return volatility and how this is related to the underlying index. First, to overcome the limited history of LETF returns data, we propose a method for simulating implied LETF tracking errors while still accounting for their dependence on underlying index returns. This allows for the incorporation of the complete history of index returns in an LETF returns model. Second, to isolate the effects of daily, leveraged compounding on LETF volatility, we propose an innovative method for simulating daily index returns with a chosen constraint on the multi-day period return. By controlling for the performance of the underlying index, the range of volatilities observed in a simulated sample can be attributed to compounding with leverage and the presence of tracking errors. Our nonparametric methods are flexible-easily incorporating any chosen number of days, leverage ratios, or period return constraints, and can be used in combination or separately to model any quantity of interest derived from daily LETF returns.T1  - Simulation of Leveraged ETF Volatility Using Nonparametric Density EstimationVL  - 05DO  - 10.4236/jmf.2015.55039JO  - Journal of Mathematical FinanceER  -

In your second year, I recommend, you start buying sector based/thematic ETF's like SMH (semiconductors) and QCLN (green energy). Most of your portfolio should still be in broad based index ETF's like SPY & QQQ.

In your third year, a few of stocks, but don't spend too much (maybe 10% of your portfolio) bc it takes time to become a good long term investor/stock picker and losing 10% of your portfolio while you're younger isn't a big deal. Accept mistakes because you will make them, but keep them small.

Start reading books, following people on twitter like Brian Feroldi, and reading boards like this. Study concepts like risk management (e.g. position sizing, barbell strategy, hedging) and how macro economic conditions affect the stock market.

Again, as long as you understand what you're doing and the tax implications that follow, it's all up to you. Understanding what you're doing does not mean you will guarantee a gain or can say where we will be next year, only that you understand the risk you are taking. This is the case with a leveraged ETF just as it is the case with a non leveraged product.

Everything about investing depends on the choices we are comfortable making and some chance involved between the start and end of our investing cycle. Losses compound just as gains compound, depending your cycle and choices, you may have outsized losses, or outsized gains.

Your assumptions are incorrect and I am unsure why the performance over a week/month/year matters. With most LETFs, such as UPRO or TQQ, the leverage is reset daily.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""scam"" or ""you pay higher funding fees for the daily reset""? The fee to hold these funds is close to 1% per year (pretty good considering you are getting 3x leverage). You don't pay ""more"" for the daily reset, that is just the nature of the fund. Happy to discuss further if you have any questions, but I think you have misunderstood the fundamental nature of leveraged ETFs and how the daily reset works.

LETF,ETFs,sec934,How is the general consensus on Leveraged ETFs?,hunzgmp,"I’ve set to 60% VOO, 40% SSO (2x daily S&P 500) in my Roth IRA. I repositioned into this after VOO had come down from $440 to $420, with an eye toward buying into the decline on each pay day. 

Here are my thoughts: 

You really need to be disciplined to use leveraged ETFs and come out well. Parts of this are considering worst case scenarios up front, being honest about what you’re prepared to hold through, being honest about how *long* you’re prepared to be underwater, and having a stated strategy to adhere to. This is critical even when hedging, because hedge strategies can break periodically. 

For example, I looked at HFEA and determined that I’m not comfortable with 3x leverage when bonds may not reliably hedge. However, I am comfortable being full stocks and holding 2x leverage. I looked at back tests, with a specific eye toward underwater periods, and understood that I could underperform the index for well over a year (possibly multiple years). I committed to continuing to make installments on pay days (not pulling forward or holding back), and to be at peace with the outcomes. 

Absent those prior commitments and understandings, your experience during a correction looks a bit like this: 

“BABE! THE MARKET IS DOWN AGAIN!!! THIS IS IT! IT’S THE BIG ONE! WE’RE MOVING IN WITH YOUR UNCLE IN ALASKA AND LIVING OFF THE LAND! $#!+ IS HITTING THE FAN RIGHT NOW!!! DO YOU HEAR ME?! THERE IS NO RETIREMENT! THERE IS NO SECURITY! GRAB THE CAT, I’LL GET THE KIDS! PACK LIGHT, WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE!!!” 

… and that’s basically just a typical, VOO down 1% kind of a day about two weeks into a pull back. 

Leverage will mess with you if you’re not truly prepared.",1643421237.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/sec934/how_is_the_general_consensus_on_leveraged_etfs/hunzgmp/

It's your money, but I think it will be a mistake. You will be taking too much risk, esp. with leverage, and chasing past performance is even a bigger mistake. Past performance does not guarantee future performance. If you want to treat leverage with <5%, that may be OK (I call that play money).

I restarted retirement contributions way late (I am a decade older than you), due to life circumstances beyond my control. I spent one year thinking very (very) hard about how I can make up for the lost time. Every time I came to the conclusion that taking extra risks will not pay off to the risk equivalents. So I am sticking to indices until retirement. I will switch over to SCHD partially post-retirement.

Rationale behind choosing S&P 500 is it has broad exposure to various all the sectors (Tech, ecommerce, health, financial..). Yes now its tech heavy because they are the ones in bull trend but this wan's the case decades ago, the S&P committee will hand pick those that satisfy the top rating. so may be in 15 years we might have some other sector (clean energy) on top. So I don't have to worry rebalancing my portfolio.

Also there are lot of overlaps with Large cap growth and S&P 500 but I trust the underlying index (Russell 1000, Nasdaq, Dow Jones large cap growth)  to pick the right ones as time changes.

LETF,Bogleheads,1ned2au,19 and building an aggressive long term portfolio with factors and leverage,ndp5ea2,"\> I believe that there’s too much research on factors that it would be stupid for me not to invest in it.

  
I don't like that framing and I don't even think factor investing advocates would agree with it, at least if they're reasonable.  While it is correct that pretty much everyone agrees that in the past we observed a fairly large premium for these factors, there's not a lot of agreement about what exactly caused them or whether we should consider those values predictive of the future.

At a high level either the market systematically mispriced those stocks in the past, or investors rationally decided to avoid those kind of stocks because they were an additional source of risk that wasn't worth the higher returns.  If you believe the first explanation, well, we all know about these factors now so you would expect those mispricings to get corrected.  And we do see the factor premiums have basically disappeared post publication, which isn't evidence this is true (factor premiums were time varying even in the historical record) but does sort of point that direction.  Or if you believe the second risk based explanation instead you should have a very solid explanation of what exactly about these stocks is risky, why that risk is priced instead of idiosyncratic/ diversifiable, and why you want to take on a lot of that risk when according to your own story most people don't think it's worth the risk.  Given that the nature of the risk itself is so murky I'm skeptical of people's ability to identify themselves as particularly tolerant of those risks compared to their tolerance for volatility.  

Which I hope doesn't come off as me saying that it's stupid \*to\* factor invest.  I'm just pointing out there are good reasons not to and you probably need to look into it more if you think it would be stupid.  You could reasonably come out on either side, but the important thing is to make a decision you can stick with and for me that means looking at all sides of an issue so you aren't blindsided when later on you realize it wasn't so straightforward.

Why not just start with one fund like VTI or VOO? Compare average returns on some different ETFs or mutual funds and decide what you want to start with. VOO or VTI could be paired with VXUS.

However, if unsuccessful, there is a risk of not being able to pay back the borrowed money.

Leverage is the act of borrowing money and investing it, fundamentally. 

So if you have 3x leverage, you’ve borrowed 3x what you actually own. That’s 3x the gain, yes, but also total collapse on a bad day, and on a normal day you can lose money thanks to compounding:

LETF,Bogleheads,1g32u82,Jack Bogle's opinion on how to leverage?,lruyx67,"I was just about to make a post almost exactly like this. The only reason you would avoid leveraged ETF's is volatility decay and how the leveraged ETF will go down in a sideways market. I will argue that the fear of leveraged ETF's are over blown for two reasons

1: Volatility decay is well understood among knowledgeable investors. What people don't mention is that your compound interest is also greatly magnified. Look at SSO since 2006. It's returned 930%. Compared to the S&P which has only returned 360%. This includes the 2008 financial crisis. TQQQ is 17,000% since 2010

2: Leveraged ETF's recover FAST. A decade’s not forever, but it counts as “long” in most people’s books, and 2010 to 2020 was a decade that included all the usual volatility and many TQQQ crashes along the way, such as:

-44% in the debt ceiling brinkmanship of 2011 (but then rising 130% in the next 7.5 months)

-41% from July 2015 to February 2016 (but then rising 73% in the next 7.5 months)

-27% from January to April 2018 (but then rising 63% in the next 5 months)

-55% in the autumn tech-wreck of 2018 (but then rising 129% in the next 11 months)

-69% in the February to March 2020 covid crash (but then rising 344% in the next 5 months)

As long you can routinely DCA into leveraged ETF's, then even in side ways markets you will be making a good return as you consistently buy dips

Using margin is a good but works best if you only want to leverage around 1.2x If you want to achieve around 1.4 leverage or higher then a combination of both margin and leveraged ETF's might be the best. I'm exploring this option now. At the moment about 8 percent of my portfolio is in leveraged ETF's. I will continue to DCA into them as long as i keep getting a paycheck.

LETF,Bogleheads,1dop0ng,Why Are So Many Self-Proclaimed Bogleheads Putting Money into QQQ/QQQM/TQQQ?,laead4l,"I mostly agree with you. The Boglehead method is to buy and hold, for the long term, broad market index funds. For the US market, the broadest market index fund is a total market index fund like VTI/VTSAX, which makes it the optimal choice. Second best is an S&P500 index fund like VOO, as it very closely mirrors the total market. If you don't have access to a total market index fund in a 401k, an S&P500 index fund is a fine substitute. Even if, for some reason, you preferred VOO to VTI, I wouldn't say that disqualifies you from being a Boglehead. VOO is still broadly diversified, its performance is a near match for VTI.


But any less diversified than an S&P500 fund, things start to diverge from the Boglehead strategy. QQQ and other Nasdaq100 index funds are still correlated with VTI but have noticeable differences from the performance of the total US market. If, for some reason, you ended up in a retirement plan where a Nasdaq100 index fund was the broadest market fund available (no available total market or S&P500 index funds), then I would say investing in it is the best you can do and is consistent with being a Boglehead. If, for whatever reason, you had access to and invest most of your portfolio in broad fund like VTI and decided to use QQQ to add a small tilt toward toward large cap (which I wouldn't recommend), then I would still say that's consistent with being a Boglehead (the Boglehead Guide to Investing says small tilts are fine, if you do desire,  though personally I'd recommend tilting *away* from large cap if you're going to tilt at all).


But allocating most or all of your portfolio to QQQ when you have broader market index funds available? That's not consistent with being a Boglehead and is almost certainly a decision made to chase the recent outperformance of QQQ. It's a dangerous strategy because QQQ is much more volatile than VTI/VOO, and just like it can meaningfully outperform the total market, it can also meaningfully underperform the total market. Here's a backtest showing as much: https://testfol.io/?d=eJy9jzFLBEEMhf9L6inW5orpBDmwOVwUUeRY4k5mHc1lzsy4hyz73y%2FnCoqFlZgqjxfe9zLBwPkR%2BQoVdwX8BKWi1i5gJfAADkjCN7W4IzL4s8bGAYbnLklkrCkL%2BIhcyEGP5SlyPoBvvkQXlV4t555Q%2Bd3SNDMnGbpDknC6XTWzg33WGjOnbHUeJhDcfbKTjFTqRRpTsFLmVn0zlJL1R%2Blp%2FSO9pv6FdElZdnPbtjVrT9qT1I8n5q2DoDhY1dn9Oe92fbm5%2B1%2FizfX5b8TtfARcuKcV


tldr: don't invest in QQQ unless you want to add a small tilt to it (small tilts are consistent with the Boglehead strategy, though it's probably a misguided approach to tilt to large cap specifically) or have no broader market index fund available in your retirement account (which is unlikely; most 401ks/403bs offer at least an S&P500 index fund, if not a US total market index fund).

LETF,Bogleheads,1dop0ng,Why Are So Many Self-Proclaimed Bogleheads Putting Money into QQQ/QQQM/TQQQ?,ladd911,"Young investors haven't experienced a prolonged down market in their lifetime to see how the boglehead approach works, so they may intellectually grasp the concept of how diversification protects them, but they don't know it experientially.

Meanwhile they're watching a narrow sector experiencing prolonged massive gains, and they want some of that.

If you asked the average investor, ""which do you prefer to do: maximize gains, or maximize diversification?"" I would wager most of them would prefer to maximize gains.

It requires a bit of exercise to see how maximizing diversification is an effective and efficient way to maximize gains while minimizing effort.

You can beat boglehead through luck in the short term, or you can beat it by being very smart and working hard if you are Warren Buffet. 

But if you are average lucky, lack information and analytical skills, or don't want to be managing your investments actively and then have to pay close attention to the economy and understand how the market works so that you can actually take advantage of the opportunities that exist, then probably you can't do any better than boglehead.

That said, it doesn't take a whole lot of analytical skill to see that the tech sector is likely to be where a lot of growth and profit happen, and want a concentration there, despite the boglehead philosophy. Boglehead is already there, market weighted, though. Warren Buffet is concentrated on a couple of stocks that he really likes, and understands very well. As for you, you can be diversified ""enough"" (relative to your own tolerance of risk) without buying the entire market.

My concern is that you are already taking an unscientific/emotional path to breaking down your investments. 

What arbitrary length of time will you choose to break up these contributions? Is the rest of your money just sitting in a checking account in the interim? When the market has a correction, are you more likely to also cease making those weekly/monthly/quarterly contributions, waiting for a bottom to hit?

tbf, because lump sum is only something like 68% often the correct choice, I wouldn't say DCA is outright bad. Still a form of timing the market, but it also hedges bets lowering expected return but also reducing volatility/potential loss. 

It's like telling someone ""you can either (A) flip one coin, you get $100 for heads and lose $50 for tails, or (B) flip ten coins, you get $8 for heads and lose $5 for tails"". We know the mathemarical best choice is A. But B more likely assures gain, albeit a smaller expected one.

In simulations, that suggests that TQQQ would have been down something like -99.5% to -99.8%. If that happened today, it could drop the capitalization of its current AUM from around $22B to $44M. Then you have to figure that boatloads of investors would be abandoning the strategy, at least half of them. So you have to ask- in a scenario where the fund has been devastated by catastrophic losses, and is hemorrhaging investors, with the cost of borrowing and managing the fund, at what point would ProShares make the business decision to close it? We don’t know but there is a limit somewhere that they would hit that compel them to close it and liquidate. I don’t even know how well ProShares would be holding up as a fund provider in a scenario bad enough. They could go bankrupt or get acquired and liquidate everything. Because these funds are made up primarily of derivatives and not the underlying securities, they are not portable, and liquidation is the last resort which could result in realization of all losses.

LETF,Bogleheads,1dle43y,Tell me what to do with my money.  I am at your discretion,l9oetpv,"I'm in the UK so can't give full advice, but I am self employed on a medium income.

First of all, your whole ""I know more than everyone, but don't get the job"" spiel is giving off major red flags as someone who has hired people before. It shows really poor interpersonal skills to me. I would maybe work on that if you want a job. But regardless, in terms of money:

You need a business account, a business savings account, a personal debit account and then your investments. 

The business account is for the day to day business finance. It is the account people pay you into, the account that pays for business overheads, etc. 

You could keep this at a pretty tight level depending on how set your overheads are. As you are doing consulting, I assume they are pretty low. I like to keep mine at around £5000-8000 as I order materials for clients. If you have fixed overheads that would be easier to plan.

I pay myself a fixed sum every month. I worked out average monthly income and then deducted tax and a bit more to make sure I wasn't taking too much out. I don't always make that much post tax profit, but most months I make much more so it balances out. The rest goes into the business savings account. I use this to save for taxes mostly, but there is usually surplus savings. Earning decent interest is a bit novel, but it's been great making money on my taxes.

With the money that goes into my personal account I have automatic monthly deposits into my investment account. I have these set up so that it automatically invests into a world index and S&P500 and then some cash that I use to keep everything balanced the way I want. As I am in the UK, this is into a Stock and Shares ISA as this is the most tax efficient savings that isn't a pension (no capital gains). 

With the business surplus I invest that into a self invested personal pension.

As for your current situation:

Sell crypto and move into stable investments such as a world index or S&P500 index plus some in a bond based fund. I do an 80:20 split of equity to bonds. 

Sort out your accounts, figure out what you will be due in taxes and move everything you can from Paypal into an easy access savings account with decent interest.",1719006135.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1dle43y/tell_me_what_to_do_with_my_money_i_am_at_your/l9oetpv/

I need help. ,l8rgg3b,"This article about [the efficient market hypothesis](https://thedeepdish.org/efficient-market-hypothesis-is-not-dead/) got me to internalize the logic of widely diversified index funds. Perhaps it'll help you to internalize the logic too.

Ultimately, whenever you see some good gain recently, that just means you missed it. You can't know any of it ahead of time. Unless you have insider information?

The whole market, it's all random. And even if you can find some advantage, it's just as hard getting out at the right time as getting in. And is there anything new that you know that the market doesn't with you buying these funds?

Anyway, the best thing to do is to get it out of sight and out of mind.

Two things. You should just buy a Target Date *Index* Fund. Even if you believe you're finding something more optimal, surely it would make sense that buying global stocks and a touch of bonds is mostly optimal? Have it in one thing that's mostly optimal that you won't be tempted to fuck with.

If you're at Schwab, Fidelity, or Vanguard for your IRA, those have their own index based TDFs to pick from. Choose the year when you turn 65, or close to it. If you're at Robinhood, choose something like ITDI, which is Blackrock iShares's index based TDF ETF for year 2065.

But ideally, just have it be in a different account and app. If you're at Robinhood, move it to one of the other three. If you're locked into the IRA at Robinhood due to their bonuses, perhaps try trading in the taxable elsewhere.

>I was thinking of giving myself some play money in brokerage so i can have a less-consequential place to make those kind of bets. I really dont want to fuck with my retirement. 

Ultimately, this, or paper trading, is gonna be the key.

You truly need to do something to set and forget it. Retirement is years and years from now. Perhaps sooner, if you stop fucking with it.

Fiddling with stuff like this shouldn't be your hobby. If you want your hobby to make you money, find a different hobby where you can directly make money with it.

The beauty of investing is that it's actually optimal to set and forget it. And that's what will make you tons of money.

Sure, you won't be a millionaire tomorrow. But personally, at my savings rate, I'm going to be a millionaire within a decade.

For stuff that's more actionable, you may enjoy other financial stuff. I love r/fire and r/financialindependence. I love [the coastFI calculator](https://walletburst.com/tools/coast-fire-calc/). I love [the Fi flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/16xymii/fire_flow_chart_version_43/), which following is gonna leave me rich. I love reading articles about investing and finance [like this](https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series/). I don't do them as much as maybe I should, but r/creditcards stuff and r/churning stuff is cool and lets you save/make a bunch of money too.

There's a reason they call it dumb money. Don't be dumb money.

And if you must, keep it separate from your retirement. Don't be tempted to check it! Make it annoying to check it!

Staring at the numbers isn't healthy, nor is it beneficial to you.

What am I missing with this concept?",l5b7own,"I had quickly gone through your similar post and comments on on r/LETFs and wanted to give a few cents of mine here, commenting on this post, as it made a lot more sense to do so. It is just my personal perspective to ponder on as I was on the same train of thought earlier trying to chase alpha and came to the conclusion that over complexity surely leads to underperformance or just plain headaches to over indulge in portfolio management as time goes on.
1. Complex strategies VS buy and hold - When you investing in say, the broad market, you are investing into physical companies that sell products and / or services, so you are placing cash where actual transactions take place to keep economies afloat. In the above portfolio, you are trying your hand in complex financial derivatives arrangements over “uncontrollables” such as market volatility for one. 
2. Fund performance - In essence you are betting on the continued performance of the fund manager to outperform the market and / or employ complex tactics to consistently beat the market. This is a fools errand in itself and is a grave undertaking as fund managers could easily be changed or replaced that would have a direct impact on the funds performance. As they say, past performance doesn’t guarantee future results.
3. Portfolio correlation - Market diversification is just as it is required for controlling portfolio volatility, however this has to work towards your own financial position and future goals as not one size fits all. It is necessary to mitigate risks from correlated assets to help in times of changing market structure or dynamics as no one can predict the future. In having said that, the above portfolio would be, on my initial point, highly correlated to fund managers performance if you may. Also, inflows towards these funds directly would impact its performance / liquidity / spreads etc. Why would you risk your long term savings / investments to bet on a future that makes sense right now? If it is alpha you are chasing, maybe one leveraged / complex idea would do, other than following the principles of an “All weather portfolio” through complex financial instruments.
4. Fund fees - I haven’t looked at the ER for these funds, but I am expecting it to be way above market standard. So in essence, you are paying much more for indicative performance over risk of it. Why let fund managers get rich over your money while you stand to loose a sizeable portion of it.
5. Backtesting pitfalls - You are looking at sizeable historical data on funds ( that I am assuming here ) are newer and more recent than the available historical data. Which comes back to my original point that “ Past performance cannot guarantee future results”

The simulated tickers used above are already net of fees ([you can see the fees here](https://testfol.io/help)). The only fee not included is gold, which is just the spot price above, but IAUM's fee is tiny.

Absolutely true, but if I implemented this, I'd probably just keep it in a tax shelter. All of these funds do not cause UBTI issues.

> 3) Manually rebalancing is rough. This is why the bogle approach works better for most people.

The Bogle three-fund portfolio still has to be rebalanced, though. You run into the minor annoyance of having to do this unless you either let your investments drift or use a one-fund portfolio.

Shrugging off 2008 was a benefit. [Aside from that, I cherry-picked the S&P's 2009 bottom as the start date, and the above still came out comfortably ahead](https://testfol.io/?d=eJyNkUFLAzEQhf%2BKzMFTCrFSoTmLR1mslyJlmW4m22g2qZO4rV32v5uyLS4Fizll5hvem5d0ULuwRlcgYxNBdRATcio1JgIFUynnE3k%2FkXMQQF6f%2B7ka5lp0oO5kPgJQv5fWG4fJBg8q8RcJqDBujAs7UPK3KA3TZ5ZZErL7zmIcnLO%2BLnfW6%2BPsg%2BwFbAMnE5wNea%2B3Djw2J2vrW4rp0bZW553i2YopB0Ff0dOFerLVB%2FGgMtwz1evG7DPcElfkE6jprBcjHlu7v8br4PQ1fuBwuOQrAZqxzm9xHD0FWtwWNzMp%2F5%2FrOXj6K9WiWL6%2BjF3z34xtV%2F0PZbekyQ%3D%3D), and the S&P never had a rolling 15-year period that exceeded that of the above (the closest it got was 1% per year off).

I don't know; it just seems like we could have been having this conversation in 2007, talking about how there's no reason to expect anything to beat emerging market stocks or real estate. The inclusion of more asset classes makes portfolio performance in aggregate less episodic.

> it begs the question: what is it that you are trying to achieve?

I guess a bit of financial alchemy. I'm taking the conclusions of modern portfolio theory to their logical extreme (combining different risk premia to create a whole that's much more efficient than any of the pieces in isolation), ideally to come up with a portfolio that performs well on an absolute basis over the full business cycle, has limited negative impact from different kinds of macro shocks, and is simple to set up and maintain (obviously there is a lot of complexity in the theory behind this, but once implemented, it's just hitting a button on M1 Finance four times a year to maintain).",1715976657.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1cuasxl/a_highoctane_noequity_noleverage_portfolio_what/l4i7564/
LETF,Bogleheads,1cuasxl,"A high-octane, no-equity, no-leverage portfolio? What am I missing with this concept?",l4p5qol,"Essentially yes - assets that contribute a large amount of vol, as long as not positively correlated, would I think be expected to contribute risk premia over assets with less vol that themselves would also not be correlated. I think we're all more or less operating on that assumption already on some level. Most people around here don't seem to care to own corporate bonds, since they are higher on the capital stack than equities, and therefore do not carry a risk premium on that basis (there's a credit risk premium, but no equity risk premium, so vol and returns should both trend between risk-free assets and equities long-term). People will own the equities instead and offset their higher volatility with different risk premia, like going out 5+ years on the yield curve on the bond side.

I am also willing to accept higher vol from the whole portfolio if that's compensated by higher returns from the portfolio.

Chasing penny stocks to recover losses? That's like trying to put out a fire with gasoline. What made you think penny stocks, notorious for their high risk and volatility, were a good idea for someone already deep in the hole?

Looking to ""recover losses"" is a dangerous mindset. It can lead to reckless decisions. Why not focus on a long-term, more stable strategy instead of trying to hit a home run to fix past mistakes?

Here's the brutal truth: Investing isn't about making up for lost time or money. It's about making smart, well-informed decisions moving forward.

VT, the total world stock ETF, is a more diversified choice, covering global markets. But dumping everything in one shot versus monthly? That's a strategic decision. Lump-sum investing can be effective if the market goes up, but it's riskier. Dollar-cost averaging (investing monthly) can reduce the impact of volatility. What's your risk appetite after all this shitshow?

> Also thanks for clearing my perspective about, recovering losses vs investment.

You're welcome. Focusing on recovering losses is like trying to refill a leaking bucket without patching the holes. Focus on building a solid, well-thought-out investment plan. Have you considered talking to a financial advisor? It might be time to get professional help to align your investment strategy with your actual fucking goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation.

Second, other than the obvious (in a drawdown it hurts twice as bad), you will get hurt in sideways or high volatility periods. Third, the cost of leverage is much higher than it has been for awhile so there’s much less room for error. If the S&P 500 has a decade like the early 2000s where it goes nowhere, and you’re paying 6%ish for borrowing and ER, it’s going to be painful. 

If you want to take more risk than 100% equities I’d look at something like PSLDX. It’s leveraged 100 S&P 500 and 100 long bonds. It’s not a guarantee to outperform and it’s not a smooth ride. You would have suffered a 50% drawdown in 2022 while 100% equities would have been down half of that.

LETF,Bogleheads,16rzku4,TMF is killing me softly,k282wcf,"So I personally use a fair amount of leverage but there are three really important things to consider and there are a lot of good reasons why people don't just naively recommend LETFs and they come with warnings and FINRA seems salivating to get rid of them (pretty sure the only LETF allowed on vanguard is NTSX not sure if that's still the case).

1. Leverage is dangerous. You will get insane drawdowns. In a situation where you have a two fund portfolio that is 3x levered and both assets go down at the same time by a substantial amount, you can get completely wiped out. Do not just buy and hold these hoping they turn around.
2. I'd highly recommend fully reading through both HFEA threads, the Lifecycle Investing thread, and the modified HFEA thread with ITT. They're long but you owe it to yourself to do so.
3. You need to understand why TMF is going down. Inverted yield curve, borrowing cost, 3x levered on LTT when the yield has increased dramatically. If you did HFEA starting in 1950 and retired 30 years later, you would have retired with a lot less money than someone doing a ""VTI and chill"" strategy or an unlevered lifecycle allocation into bonds. TMF is in a special type of hell right now with no immediate sign of reversal

I hope this comes off as direct advice and not rude but you really need to do the homework before considering such an aggressive strategy it will save you a lot of pain in the long term. It honestly might be best to take an loss, take it as a learning lesson, and revisit your approach - as I mentioned I tend to use a fair amount of leverage, now is not one of those times. One of the core assumptions, I believe it is stated on page 1 of the original HFEA approach is that this will not work in a rising rates environment. Look at LTT & S&P returns in '73-'74, '22, and the weird rate hike cycle in '94 (S&P held water here but you can see how much of a blood bath this would have been had equities had a bad year as an example of a near miss for HFEA getting crushed).

I don't think HFEA is a great approach, and even if I did I would stay the hell away from anything this complicated without understanding the mechanisms behind it.",1695692328.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/16rzku4/tmf_is_killing_me_softly/k282wcf/

I ***JUST*** started to look into the possibility of TLT and TMF while doing full DD on the holdings, prospectus, past rate hikes, past inflation periods, post-WW2 inflation/growth/rates given the correlation to our high debt, potential of further rate hikes, etcetcetc 

And IF I complete my full research, believe it's a good investment, and see an opportunity to go in then I'd probably start going in slowly into TMF or TLT since the bond market and Fed moves slowly. Probably DCA into it over the span of 1 year isn't even fast since the trade can be very rewarding on the upside, but one might have to go in with the intention of holding 5 to +10 years. And even that assumes certain things like the fund not getting closed, US not defaulting, eveyone not getting nuked to death, inflation coming down instead of going up which would force the Fed to further hike rates, etcetcetc. It's not the stock market which is trying to predict the economy 6-9 months into the future.

LETF,Bogleheads,16rzku4,TMF is killing me softly,k2yxo0r,"Mostly agree that there is a lot of upside and that there is a lot of risk and thanks for the thoughts. Really anyone entering this trade needs to know it's risky and you do.

Separating TMF and TLT:

TMF is a mess at the moment. I'm not going to crunch the numbers, frankly because it's so far from close to a good investment unless you're in a space constrained portfolio and like crazy high into LETFs on the equities side (like HFEA I get it, I'm not a HFEA fan but totally understand the need to hold TMF to make that strategy feasible for those who subscribe to it). Borrowing 3x to buy a fixed income instrument with a 1%ish worse yield. So that's about 3% cost. Management fee, let's say that's 4% total. Volatility decay varies of course but 2% is a conservative estimate. So your holding cost in a flat market right now with the same depths and highs of oscillating around a fixed price are like minimum 6%. CAGR for TLT this year is -9.23%. 3x that is -27.69%. TMF performance is -35.54% so ya, TMF itself has been really bad compared to TLT this year even accounting for the fact that it's a bad market for LTT. I'm just not buying anything where I know I give 6%+ in holding cost ever and that was a guess who knows where it will go but it was closer to 8% YTD.

TLT though, doesn't have those issues. Like you said it's high risk high reward. I don't hold it but I think it's totally reasonable particularly you're predominantly long equities even though I'd prefer BND if it's a long term portfolio and not levered in like a 80/20 type risk tolerance.

So that said, I have no doubt there is a very good chance TLT is a great trade but I am way too bearish on it at the moment.

This really gets into non-BH stuff and feels like sinning in a church if you want my more nuanced opinion on going long TLT right now though:

* The yen carry trade has had an outright messy couple months. I'm totally cool letting the dust settle on LTT. I think LTT is abnormally high risk ATM and it's impossible to know how much price is being impacting by the yen vs the fed. I just don't believe the price of LTTs react quickly to information. Sinning, yes I know, they scare the hell out of me when there is not a clear trend and there's so many situations where LTT pricing did not react rationally IMO. Someone on CNBC facetiously said they trade like meme stocks a couple weeks back. I can't say I disagree. LTT behavior is so inexplicable to me I'd in general say I'm a semi-strong or weak EMH believer. LTT pricing makes me question even being a weak EMH believer the information->price lag seems that insane to me to the point where I do have gone short LTT exposure solely based on real yields and inflation momentum. I have never gone short any other security once based on my opinion of value and there being a momentum factor. So that's my overall opinion of the LTT market :-)
* I trust in the equity risk premium. I'd just rather have risk premia on equities than bonds in general but it's negative duration premium that really pushes me over the edge. Reinvestment risk is real too though so to each their own but I like the shorter end. Different risks but I'd rather manage reinvestment risk at the moment than have to hold negative duration premium in hope of a reversal.
* Risk-adjusted returns for LTT are really rough compared to a lot of other securities including other treasuries. They have a 40+ year existence including an awesome run for 95% of that time and consistently have worse risk-adjusted returns that other parts of the yield curve. I am pretty sold on leverage aversion hypothesis explaining the implied consistent relatively high price of LTT.

Ackman's bet is interesting. I did short/short spy/LTT for almost 15 months straight and I like to think it was smart but it was also very lucky with how high CAPE was when I entered into it and then Ukraine happened. Short SPY I was holding as hedge against if the short LTT backfired, long STT short LTT is way more aggressive. Sometimes I have a little trouble following his logic TBH but obviously he has a track record of hitting home runs and also rough losses but that's his profile and it pays off the way he trades.

I don't know if Buffett despises any financial instrument more on earth than long term treasuries so color me not the least bit surprised by his actions. He's been trashing LTT since the GFC when they entered into a massive bull market and never backed off once. I think his general argument of ""if I'm buying something for 20 years why not have a risk premium attached to it"" is a really fundamental question about LTT in any portfolio. Sure they are shock absorbers for market crashes sometimes. He handles equity risk with low beta high quality companies and leverage to juice the returns. I'm not Warren Buffett so I buy STT and ITT to hedge and happily collect the duration premium and if my treasuries are down, it's offset by equity gains but I think his point about LTT is true regardless of how one approaches handling equity risk. It's really a question of what kind of insurance do you want and LTT seems like pretty poor insurance in general. Frankly if it were better, it wouldn't have such solid returns because insurance needs to cost something. And if you're buying something for a long duration, and not using it as insurance, you're buying it for gains, so why not buy a stock?

Check out Ray Dalio's comments. He's the one who is actually making me paranoid about my favorite position of leveraged long equities and blended treasury durations. The past two decades he's gone from ""lever up fixed income"" to ""it's great but maybe add more non fixed income to hedge equity"" to ""who the hell is buying bonds in 2021 are those people insane"" to ""the US might lose its status as reserve currency"". I'm not quite there with his current opinion but I think his reasoning is sound enough that if LTT absolutely crater in price, people should be looking at that outcome as a ""1%-10% chance event occurred"" and not ""total black swan no one could have seen this coming"". We are pumping ludicrous amounts of treasury supply onto the market and it's not the majority of demand for them but China is a seller now and Japan is wobbly trending towards a much less aggressive buyer of US debt.

My single largest concern is that the fed can control the interest rate. It cannot control demand outside of QE and it cannot control fiscal policy. I agree with this part, if as you say, the economy goes into a recession the fed will cut rates. This will also make servicing the US debt easier. I think the problem is what next? We always pass stimulus and revenues are lower in recessions with less economic activity and taxation. Tax cuts, the IRA, GFC legislation etc. that increases the deficit and causes more supply on the open market. If demand isn't there to pick it up, it gets hairy really fast. It strikes me as very plausible that debt to GDP is like 140-150%+ by the end of large recession in the next year or so if one occurs. If that recovery coincides with weak treasury demand and the market clearing price for LTT is depreciating, the market is going to dictate yields and it's going to be really really unpleasant for LTT and really everything with our debt level. This would be a pretty serious death spiral for US debt that hasn't happened before to us at least but like any borrower who is accruing more debt and not outpacing the growth of it with revenue, borrowing tends to get more expense.",1696143567.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/16rzku4/tmf_is_killing_me_softly/k2yxo0r/

I wasn't trying to make a point — merely presenting raw data.

One observation is that I see 19 year olds coming here and the 3-fund portfolio is recommended to them as if it were the be-all-and-end-all investing panacea. At 19 they are a good 45 years from retirement yet they are being advised to invest like 80-year-old grandpas. Then I come along and suggest that bonds put an unnecessary drag on growth for young people and suggest at least looking at 2x index ETF's.

Here are portfolios I think are better suited to 19 year olds and which will have Grandpa reaching for the Geritol :)

LETF,Bogleheads,14dg1hs,Why Not SPXL instead of VOO?,jopys3e,"Leveraged investing as a general matter is an acceptable idea for a young person. Millions of people do it (albeit unwittingly) by taking out a large mortgage on their home purchase. Balance sheets don’t care about the reason you wanted the debt - your investments are leveraged regardless. Others access the benefits of leverage by investing in companies that are themselves highly leveraged.

However, leveraged ETFs are a TERRIBLE idea for a long-term buy and hold investor because they reset leverage daily, and the short of why that’s important is that they deliver the 2x or 3x index return on a daily basis, but not on a long term basis due to volatility decay. So if the S&P returns 10% annually over 10 years, a 2x leveraged ETF will not return 2x that amount or even close to it, most likely. And in exchange, the downside risk can be astronomical and negatively life altering if you hit a bad market run.

Leverage always seems like a cheat code to success, but really it’s mostly a way for naive and inexperienced investors to get hammered into the reality that their risk tolerance isn’t what they once believed. Stay in the normal lanes - keep your leverage to a modest amount in a safe loan structure like a mortgage.",1687192188.0,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/14dg1hs/why_not_spxl_instead_of_voo/jopys3e/

just because you're young and can take on more risk doesn't mean you should take on *uncompensated risk.* speculation and single-asset investing are extremely risky, and full of idiosyncratic (uncompensated) risk. if you want to invest in crypto:

* develop a theoretical reason that supports your allocation - are you currency hedging like forex? are you looking for a stable store of value like gold or silver? do you believe that bitcoin is somehow a productive asset like shares in a company? do you believe bitcoin is like an interest-bearing instrument such as government or corporate bonds? ""line goes up""/""fire emojis all up in that one guy's youtube channel"" is not a good reason to invest in something.
* reduce the idiosyncratic risk you're taking on through diversification - if crypto is like foreign currency or like precious metals or like shares of the S&P, you should probably also invest in all of it, meaning all or at least very many crypto currencies, just as you wouldn't take 100% tesla as your equities position",1680546421.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/12ai4gk/whats_better_than_just_vt/jetfh1e/

I would probably just stick to a HFEA Portfolio, rebalanced quarterly if I was trying to pick something to not look at for 30 years.

Volatility decay in a decade-long sideways market would also be a bummer, when a decent yielding bond fund or international stocks might be missed.

Something like UPRO, AVUV, VXUS, TMF, BAR, equally-weighted (1.5x total exposure) might be nice, and better diversified. You could add XLU or UTSL in too for utilities.

This does not incorporate expense ratios nor the cost of leverage which has become rather significant - the overnight lending rate is over 4% and the carry cost of a strategy like r/HFEA is up to 10% so even just a flat market can harm you. Leveraged funds close all the time because of decay or outflows. Below a certain AUM it’s no longer profitable for the fund provider to operate them, or the fund itself may run out of cash. Thus you are risking total loss of your investment.

If you are interested in using leverage, look up “[lifecycle investing](https://www.lifecycleinvesting.net/)” which suggests starting at 2x at a very young age and gradually working down to 1x before retirement. However, even the study that idea is based assumes a possibility of total loss early on in one’s investing timeline and realistically only a tiny fraction of investors would have the risk tolerance for that. You could also look at [Wisdom Tree’s Efficient Core funds](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/ntsx/) which use a more modest 1.5x, leveraging only treasuries using futures contracts.

LETF,Bogleheads,zouj0z,Can someone give me a word of advice regarding my current investment position?,j0plpf8,"So… I would personally not invest my portfolio the way you have because it’s more leverage than I am comfortable with, and I don’t trust the 3x funds for long term hold (high expense ratio, increasing cost of debt, price decay). That said, it’s not a bad allocation. You have mostly VT, then mostly NTSX [which is a solid fund](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/ntsx/), and then a pretty small amount (15%) in a HFEA allocation. You are seeing steeper than market declines because both stocks and bonds are down this year which is something many newer investors did not anticipate, but your portfolio has performed as expected.

What happened is either you didn’t understand how the portfolio would act in various market conditions, or you overestimated your tolerance for volatility and/or for tracking error when using leveraged funds. And when you use high volatility strategies like this, one reason Bogleheads argue so adamantly against them is because you HAVE to stick with them when they underperform or you will sell at the lows and end up much worse off than a simple market portfolio.

This is a rare instance where I would suggest staying the course with an allocation you regret. Markets are down and you are leveraged so you are down worse. But markets will recover. It could take many years but, unless the leveraged funds crap out entirely, you should expect to recoup your losses. UPRO bottomed at the end of September and TMF bottomed at the end of October. They could always go down more but I would try to look away from the carnage and stay invested until they recover from the drawdowns and then change to an unleveraged portfolio.",1671371741.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/zouj0z/can_someone_give_me_a_word_of_advice_regarding_my/j0plpf8/

Backtesting to create hindsight-opitimized portfolios is a dangerous game.",i8krluj,"I was always interested in HFEA and think it has merit as a clever way to beat the market and I got a little bit of FOMO over it but was concerned that 3x was too clever by half. For a hot second last decade I considered HFEA in my Roth but I could never invest in it myself for a few reasons:

1. The concern you expressed: that it turns out to be a rosy data mining product - one of those “too good to be true” ideas where it seems like beating the market is easy. “What could possibly go wrong?”. We know we’ve had 10-year drawdowns in the S&P 500 this century and that is obvious in backtests. But [the last major bear market in long treasuries](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2022/03/what-does-a-bond-bear-market-look-like/) (1960-1981) predates much of the available backtesting data. That bond bear market started with interest rates higher than we’ve had in recent years and collided with inflation like we are seeing now. Put 2 + 2 together and imagine what would happen with another 10-year US stock bear market AND a 20-year US long treasuries bear market, and you are looking at potentially a very, very deep and long portfolio drawdown.

2. These leveraged ETFs are still fairly novel products and we don’t know exactly how they will behave. There is talk of regulating them and many platforms have already or are considering restricting them. If you have a leveraged ETF portfolio with a deep long, drawdown, the losses will be compounded by the high expense ratios (close to 1% for UPRO and TMF), the impact of increasing borrowing rates on the leverage, and volatility decay from the daily leverage resets. It’s even possible that in a long treasuries bear market that the combination of NAV decline and outflows could cause a fund like TMF to close and then you are SOL. This is one reason that some have warned these high leverage ETFs are not meant for long term use - will they be around long enough for you to recover from deep drawdowns or will you just get liquidated at a huge loss? Time will tell but that’s not a risk I am willing to take.

3. I want to be retired in 10-15 years. I don’t want a portfolio that has the potential for a 15-20 year drawdown that could take (who knows?) 30 years to recover. I think a portfolio diversified into US/Intl stocks (including small caps) and short/int bonds is going to be much more reliable for my timeframe. More importantly, I don’t *need* to outperform the market to reach my goals - just 5% CAGR in 15 years will get it done -  so there’s not much sense in taking the risk of underperforming it. Many folks in HFEA are feeling a LOT of stress right now and watching market returns daily and I don’t need that in my life.",1652536356.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/upbzkg/hedgefundies_excellent_adventure_update_this/i8krluj/

1) So back testing to the '70s actually does show some under performance compared to the index which is expected because you're leveraging LTTs. But it actually doesn't perform nearly as badly as one might expect. It performed fine in the '60s and very well in the '80s. People forget that HFEA is a yield play on bonds as well, so higher interest rates actually help to buffer lower equity returns. 

2) I'd say this is actually the biggest risk to the strategy. Although we haven't had any major issues with 3x leveraged funds utilized in the strategy, and I don't anticipate the will be any... There is the potential of looming regulation to lock retail investors out of leveraged products. 

3) This is absolutely fair. If a 5% CAGR is sufficient for your needs and goals I see no reason to risk a significant portion of your net worth on strategies that take on more risk.

Neglecting volatility decay, you lose less than 3x the underlying on the way down and gain faster than 3x the underlying on the way up. It's volatility that is the demon; but frequent rebalancing can help take advantage of volatility by ratcheting as funds oscillate.

In your example, with no volatility the drop in the 3x portfolio would have been about 2.7x the underlying (32.4% loss, leaving 48% to make up) and the rise would have been about 3.4x the underlying. The point that the 3x LETF recovery takes longer stands in this example, but maybe not quite as bad as it looks. 

With double the drop, again with no volatility, the 3x would only drop 2.4x the underlying and would recover about 4x the underlying.  So it would putatively recover faster than the underlying.

The reason that the current scenario has worse performance for the 3x is because of volatility drag, which is the demon that drags it down in real life.

LETF,Bogleheads,td9f1i,Looking for a review of my portfolio,i0id5b4,"I don’t care for the complexity and overlap of the portfolio - it’s very hard to know what your actual cap segment weightings are, and there’s a good chance you are overly concentrating in a small number of large cap stocks that could cause significant volatility or underperformance. But trying to keep the suggestions to a few points:

1. Get rid of SCHD because [dividends are irrelevant](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=f5j9v9dfinQ) and [you should not be excited about them](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/dividends-are-not-exciting/).

2. If you’re going to have international stocks at all (I think you absolutely should), [Vanguard recommends a minimum of 20%](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/international) to capture the diversification benefit.

3. VB is not a great small cap fund since it is 35% mid caps. If you want to complete the total US market, use VXF. If you want to concentrate in small caps, I would suggest small cap value like VIOV or AVUV.

4. If you make a US equities position that is 2 parts S&P 500 (VOO), 2 parts large cap growth (VUG), and 1 part large cap value (SCHD), you are going to get results that are 99% correlated to just holding VOO by itself. There’s no expected benefit for the added complexity - just condense those all into VOO.

5. If you want to introduce the risk of leverage that’s up to you but you better know what you are doing and be in it for the long run. If you bought SSO in 2000 (had it existed), it would have dropped something like 80% and taken 15 YEARS to recover and start outperforming VOO. So you need to be mentally prepared for the fact that, if we hit a rough patch ahead, you might be in your 50’s by the time your gamble pays off, and you can’t sell or abandon the strategy or it doesn’t work and you just lock in your losses. Leverage is not for the faint of heart, and your portfolio construction already has a number of naive flaws, so I would not recommend it.

LETF,Bogleheads,td9f1i,Looking for a review of my portfolio,i0j4v73,"My man, you need to do more research on dividends.

While it doesn’t feel like it, receiving a dividend is no different than selling a stock, and the reason being is because your stock is deducted by the exact amount of the dividend.

So just looking at the math of it (and ignoring taxes for ease), if i have stock A that is $100 and pays a 2% dividend, my position at the end of the year is $98 and I have $2 in my pockets.

If I have stock B that does not pay a dividend, but I elect to sell 2% of it to manufacture my own dividend, my position is worth $98 and I have $2 in my pocket.

There is literally no mathematical difference between receiving a dividend or selling shares.

More importantly, if you actually believe that selling at a loss would be a horrible strategy, then you should DEFINITELY be against dividends because again, dividends are forced sales.

So looking back at Stock A, let’s say it fell 20% from $100 and still pays a 2% dividend.  Stock A goes from $100 to $80, and then pays a $1.60 dividend, meaning your position is worth $78.40 and you have $1.60 in your pocket.

Stock B, same thing, the stock drops 20% from $100 to $80, and you manufacture your own 2% dividend, so you sell $1.60 of your position. Again, your stock B position is worth $78.40 and you have $1.60 in your pocket - literally 0 difference between receiving a dividend and selling your position, again.",1647202178.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/td9f1i/looking_for_a_review_of_my_portfolio/i0j4v73/

LETF,Bogleheads,td9f1i,Looking for a review of my portfolio,i0j9wwp,"No offense, but it doesn’t sound like you know that if you don’t realize that dividends are effectively a forced sale of stock.  

Like I mentioned, it doesn’t feel like a dividend is a forced sale of stock because you keep the same amount of shares, but due to the amount of the dividend being scraped off the share price, there is no mathematical difference.  You’re basically saying “I’d rather cut the pizza in 8 slices than 6, because I’d have more pizza then.”  Or said differently - if you have 10 shares worth $1 each, and you receive a 10% dividend, each share is now worth $0.90, and even if you kept the same # of shares you are in no better position than someone who also had 10 shares worth $1 each and sold 1 share - both positions are worth $9.

I understand you use dividends to pay for bills and vacations and whatnot, but you could’ve just sold whatever % of your stock and it would literally have the same effect.

Could you please point out to me the difference between receiving a dividend or selling a stock in a down market from the example I gave above, and how you could possibly think you’re better off from having received a dividend instead of selling shares (or where you think I’m getting the math wrong)?

As a reminder:

“So looking back at Stock A, let’s say it fell 20% from $100 and still pays a 2% dividend.  Stock A goes from $100 to $80, and then pays a $1.60 dividend, meaning your position is worth $78.40 and you have $1.60 in your pocket.

LETF,Bogleheads,td9f1i,Looking for a review of my portfolio,i0jeo0b,"So if you understand that selling shares and receiving a dividend is the same thing, then what is the point in focusing on dividend stocks specifically rather than all stocks, and manufacture your own dividend?  Dividends have been studied as a factor and do not provide any sort of outperformance compared to non-dividend paying stocks, so you’re just potentially losing expected return by focusing only on one half of the market if you only care about stocks that pay dividends.

“I will have at some point 1000 shares, maybe a higher income due to the principal increase and div increase. And still keep my 1000 shares”

My man - this is literally the whole point, you would literally not be better off. Just because you kept your shares doesn’t matter, you have to pay attention to what the stock price has done too. Meaning, if you have two identical companies that grow at identical rates, but one pays a dividend and one does not (and you instead sell shares to manufacture a dividend) you will have more shares with the dividend payer but the value of your positions will be identical since the dividend payer’s stock price will be lower, so who cares how many shares you have?  Both positions would be completely equal. Do you think someone with 1 million shares worth $1 each is better off than someone with 1 share worth $1M (I hope you say no)?

And I know you feel more comfortable. I literally above said that it doesn’t feel like you’re no different for having received a dividend instead of selling a share, but who cares about “how it feels?”  They’re the same thing.  Edit:  you make it sound like you’d rather have 1 million shares worth $1 total rather than 1 share worth $100M? I would hope you know why that makes 0 sense, and that share price does matter even if you think it doesnt

Because if you did, your position in Company X would be worth $31K today, while you would’ve missed out on your position in Berkshire Hathaway being worth $326M today (that’s million with an M, and is actually how much your position would be worth today without receiving a single dollar of dividends).

LETF,Bogleheads,scuwpw,Why not just buy and hold 3x Leveraged ETFs? insane returns,hu9qmgk,"Adding leverage introduces the risk of total loss, however slight, which needs to be a serious consideration since the single most important goal of long-term investing is portfolio survival. Offsetting this risk with another leveraged investment then depends on the persistence of historical correlations to prevent exacerbating the issue. For this reason, a leveraged portfolio HAS to be closely monitored and rebalanced according to strict rules, and can be quite stressful for the uninitiated - simulations of UPRO (3x SPY) for example show it would have dropped something like 92% in 2007-08. The unleveraged investor never has to go to bed or on vacation or into surgery at the hospital with the gnawing concern that a sudden unexpected market shift could bankrupt them if their portfolio is unattended to.

Leverage in the market significantly amplifies the notional values of securities without real liquid capital to back it up - this was a critical ingredient to the crashes of 1929 and 2008, the latter of which involved leveraged derivatives thought to be safe but ended up wiping out investment banks that were generations or even centuries old like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. Many folks suggest using leveraged long-term treasuries to counteract the risks of leveraged stocks for example. But if something very strange and unprecedented happens in those two asset classes at the same time, you could be toast. These things do very rarely occur. 

So it works well in theory, but the road to success in leveraged investing is strewn with ruins of those who flew too close to sun - IMO it should not be treated as some obvious and simple hack to magnifying returns.

LETF,Bogleheads,scuwpw,Why not just buy and hold 3x Leveraged ETFs? insane returns,hu9dfet,"I am testing some leveraged ETFs. They look great in the historic bull run we have had, but if you had bought TQQQ at the top of the dot com era those shares would still be down like 91% today - sure you DCA the whole time and it helps offset that, but I think a lot of people overestimate their tolerance for risk especially since we’ve been in a massive bull run for a decade+.

Because of the daily reset, this strategy relies much heavier on timing the market - this is not an easy thing to do. If we all knew the right time to buy and sell, as in your examples above, we’d all be multi-millionaires.

The leveraged portion of my portfolio (it’s small because, as I said, I am testing) is down 20% this last month. In a way I am grateful for this correction so that I can gauge my mood and behavior with the added risk.

I would never leverage anything close to 100% if my portfolio, probably not anything over 20% honestly.

In an environment where they are generally going up, it’s great (insane returns as you say), but sideways trading has a severely negative impact on leveraged ETFs which just track the daily change, and not change over time (as well as corrections/crashes but I figure we all know those are not favorable for a buy-and-hold portfolio).

So all said if you can stomach seeing your portfolio down possibly 20-80% and commit to DCA, quarterly rebalancing, and preferably a hedge like TMF it’s doable.

LETF,Bogleheads,riipcg,What are your thoughts on putting 5% of your Roth IRA into a levered index fund?,hozsmw4,"""Are you purposely being dense or are you really this bad at stats?""

I could ask the exact same thing.

I am speaking on a risk adjusted basis. I am trying to point out that you do not get the returns on a 3X leveraged fund that you would expect because it tracks that 3X point on a daily basis. There is decay involved in holding these long term. This is well documented and why funds that use leverage have to have a disclaimer to go along with owning them.

""And you measured it via CAGR. That's not what it means to say that ""TQQQ is 257% of the returns of QQQ from 2010"".""

That is exactly what it is. CAGR is the yearly (one year, not multiple) average. CAGR is not the 10+ year return, so you cannot compare dollar values of each holding over a 10+ year time frame to each other as they aren't comparing the same thing when comparing against 3X.

55.29% per one year average versus 21.50% one year average. 55.29/21.50 = 2.57.

Using your logic of comparing just dollar amounts, I could find an example where one fund returning 10% per year on average (A) versus another that returns 7% per year on average (B) where the 10% fund will have 3X the returns if you give me a long enough time frame (its 40 years, by the way).

Would you classify a fund (A) that returned 302% the dollar amount of the other fund (B) over 40 years a 3X fund, but yet over 20 years only returned 174%?

(B) 1.07\^40 = 14.9745

(A) 1.10\^40 = 45.2593

45.2593/14.9745 = 3.02 or 302%

(B) 1.07\^20 = 3.8697

(A) 1.10\^20 = 6.7275

6.7275/3.8697 = 1.74 or 174%

&#x200B;

""TQQQ is maybe a shit idea because of behavioral risks of premature selling -- risks that are exacerbated in bear markets. Not because the returns aren't great or that they are more ""risky"" in a purely mathematical sense.""

This, I of course agree with. I haven't seen any simulation done, but during the dotcom crash I would think an investment of $10,000 at its peak to lowest point in a fund like TQQQ would be worth something like $200 to $500. Would take someone with an extremely strong will to hold during that.

VTWAX is the same as VTSAX+VTIAX but the ratio changes based on market cap weighting (currently around 55-60 US right now I think). QQQ is already in VTI/VTSAX as it's just the NASDAQ side of the US stock market, so you would be weighting heavier to that and overlapping.

Regarding the hedgefundie portfolio, there are others that have done it here. I'm not sure if it is for novice investors, but would at least understand what you're doing if you decide to go that route. With that said, you cant do those at Vanguard as they don't offer leveraged ETFs last I checked, so you would need a different brokerage to do that.

LETF,Bogleheads,pf005u,Feedback request on the three-fund portfolio strategy,hb1qc7m,"What does owning stock in REITs have to do with buying a house?  Are you thinking that they are equivalent in terms of ""owning real estate?""  I don't think that's a valid connection to make.

SPY (S&P 500) vs. total market is not a major decision.  Look at the performance of SPY vs. VTI and you'll see that they move in roughly the same pattern because S&P is a big part of the overall market.

The three fund portfolio is a simple concept.  It's three low-cost index funds tracking U.S. stock, Int'l stock, and U.S. bonds respectively.  Execution of this approach is well-documented in the resources linked on the right-hand sidebar.  Bonds are often excluded completely until one is much closer to retirement.

As for selling taxable assets in order to religiously switch to this approach; I do not believe that is a necessary tactic.  A savvy investor maintains multiple accounts with different purposes.  Your long term retirement accounts can be easily shifted to three funds without consequence.  Your taxable account, currently invested in some good stuff like QQQ and unnamed tech companies, may not follow the Boglehead mantra but that's fine.  It can be cost-prohibitive to sell highly appreciated stock.  If they are solid companies or funds, hold them.  This is my opinion.

On the other hand, Bogleheads will strongly discourage you from owning volatile things like ARK.  But if you like ""playing"" with that using a small percentage of money, <5%, many people seem to enjoy doing that as long as it won't compromise your overall strategy if you lose most of it.",1630411821.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/pf005u/feedback_request_on_the_threefund_portfolio/hb1qc7m/

You have confidence in the company already by continuing to work there and not looking to find a new company ASAP. Many would say that it is extra risky having both your job and (above market cap weight of) your investments tied to a single company (though using something like a stock purchase program at a discount and selling immediately to move to index funds send to be a common enough and acceptable strategy).

>Should we add in a little bit of REITs

Fully included in total market funds already.

>GLD

I haven't really heard any good cases for gold, but if you want a bit as a ""bet"", that's up to you.

>Should I also sell all the other big tech names (including QQQ) I hold and not touch QQQ at all?

Since this is a taxable account, I'd at least avoid future contributions.

>Some folks have also suggested replacing total market by SPY. What do people think about this idea?

I wouldn't. There have always been big names with widespread coverage. But smaller cap companies often outperform over long enough time spans. It wasn't too long ago that the S&P 500 was one of the worst stock groups to have been invested in for a run.

Titans fall. New companies rise to take their place.
One recent example: Much of Tesla's great run was missed by the S&P 500 since they only added Tesla in December 2020, total market funds were able to capture the entire run up.

>Is there a more strategic/structured way to decide the allocation/ratio? I have heard that the ratio matters more than the exact ETFs (e.g. VOO vs VTI) in the long term and I do agree

Problem: No one knows the best ratio until it is in the past. I can point to a graph covering 37 years where anything more than 10% US dragged down overall returns, shift that time line even a little and it now favors the US.

Why?

LETF,Bogleheads,pbnfva,Criticize my portfolio!,haebprj,"According to the [CPM calculators](https://www.canadianportfoliomanagerblog.com/calculators/), VTI/VXUS (0.14) has a lower combined MER/FWT drag than either VEQT (0.26) or XEQT (0.21) in an un-registered account. Also keep in mind that once you buy these, and they rack up several years worth of capital gains, you'll be loath to sell them and realize those taxes if you then decide to switch over, so it pays to make the choice from the outset that is right for you and then stick with it. The same as with VT ... the pass-through rules on ex-US dividends make it less tax efficient than holdng VTI/VXUS at market cap weights, so if you've held it for 30 years and now your account is really large, you can't really exit the position efficiently from a tax perspective, and will just have to live with lower dividends throughout retirement.

With Norbert's Gambit, if it gets journaled same-day (i.e. you buy DLR on a market order in your CAD account, then immediately turn around and sell DLR.U on a market order into your USD account) then you're only paying the transaction fees (if any). If you have to wait several days for it to be journaled over, then you're exposed to currency fluctuation risk and that can be a problem.

I'd also recommend you read [here](https://www.pwlcapital.com/part-i-foreign-withholding-taxes-for-equity-etfs/) and [here](https://www.pwlcapital.com/part-ii-foreign-withholding-taxes-for-global-equity-global-bond-and-asset-allocation-etfs/) about foreign withholding taxes in different accounts.

With regards to the SCV tilt, make sure you have enough of it in your portfolio to make the difference you want it to. I don't know the exact numbers off-hand as I don't tilt that way, but I think you need around 20-30% of your equity portfolio to be in it to make it worthwhile (the cost and risk).

The Hedgefundie stuff, and NTSX, carry with them a risk that I don't think is talked about enough, especially when they are discussed on Reddit, and that is that they depend on stocks and bonds being un-correlated going forwards, which is not a given, since there have been periods in the past where they were correlated. If they start moving in unison again and move downwards, with 3-6X leverage on intermediate/long treasuries, an investor would be in a really bad position. They backtest well, but they amplify risk not in their movements, but on the assumptions behind why the strategy would work. They are also terrible to buy in sideways markets where volatility erodes their value.

As regards tax loss harvesting, even if you bought VT and you wanted to TLH it, you can, just by purchasing ITOT, IEFA and IEMG. I'm not sure if you could get away with buying VTI/VXUS or VTI/VEA/VWO, if they are substantially different enough from VT, but just because there isn't really a direct analog to VT (ACWI and SPGM are the closest I think), doesn't mean you can't effectively 'replicate' it's performance and nature with different ETFs, and that is all that TLH is really about, swapping out one thing you've taken a loss on for something else that costs the same, and does the same as the previous asset, but is substantially different enough that you don't violate the wash sale rules.

I also agree that VTI is ""better"" than S&P500. But it is only a small improvement, because the heavily weighted big companies make them perform basically the same and I value the improvement in decay when switching from 10% UPRO to 20% SSO way more (like 10x more, so not a close call for me).

I forgot one feedback point:

\- while you are young, I would start out with a higher SSO and small-cap-value allocation and shift it to your goal portfolio allocation over time, so you reach it closer to retirement, to average out your dollar amount market/risk exposure over time: [Ben Felix - Investing with leverage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll3TCEz4g1k)

anyways as long as you don't overleverage and hold tight in bear markets, your portfolio should give you a few extra percentage points of returns per year, and compounded over decades that will make you (and me ;)) hopefully very rich.

Btw I started with small-cap value, leveraged ETFs and margin one year ago. and it certainly worked out great.

So with Norbert's Gambit, I have done it for a while. It takes roughly 2 days (if I remember correctly) for it to journal over. Taking the currency fluctuation risk is far better than paying the Questrade conversion fee (2% or something). Not sure how to overcome this. I would guess the advantage with the CAD ETFs is that I can DCA into them, whereas I would incur the Norbert Gambit fee with the US ones if I were to buy in on a monthly basis with my paycheck. Though it seems like if I were to buy in, say 3 times a year into the US ones, it would still be worth it with a portfolio as small as 100k.

If you want a lower cost than VEQT/XEQT but to keep it in CAD, you can look into a XUU/XIC/VIU/VEE combo which at market cap weights would have an MER+FWT drag of around 0.16 for the maximum diversification (Vanguard's ex-NA ETFs typically hold more securities than Blackrock's, while Blackrock's XUU is cheaper than Vanguard's VUN), so only a little worse than VTi/VXUS. It does come with more ETFs to buy on a DCA schedule, which can rack up the fees though.

Another thing to consider with Blackrock/Vanguard Canadian ETFs is that they are often funds-of-funds which are designed to match the performance of their USD equivalents for as low a cost as possible while not actually holding the market weights. For instance, XUU is 50% S&P 500 and 42.77% ITOT, which actually gives it a slight over-weighting to large caps vs VTI. There was an issue recently when Tesla was included in the S&P 500 and the some of the Canadian ETFs that track the US markets didn't actually follow the index particularly closely because of this. 

Also note that, as I'm sure you're aware, VEQT/XEQT ≠ VTI/VXUS since VEQT/XEQT overweight Canadian equities quite significantly, mostly at the expense of emerging markets. The rationale for this is that holding Canadian equities at a larger portion of your portfolio replicates the stability of developed ex-US markets and the performance and anti-correlation of emerging markets, but with more favorable dividend taxation treatment. While this has been true historically, it may not be looking forward, so if your job and house and all of your money is also in Canada/CAD, plus you have a large over-weighting of Canadian stocks, it does expose you to greater geopolitical risk by concentrating so much within Canada.

>The reason you mentioned is why I didn't go with Hedgefundie. I believe holding 10% UPRO is good enough for me, leverage wise.

Exactly, I do the same, you get a good performance bump with virtually no risk attached to it (though I only do around 5% myself).",1629967387.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/pbnfva/criticize_my_portfolio/haehbb5/
LETF,Bogleheads,pbnfva,Criticize my portfolio!,haj5bqm,"In terms of the timing, I meant that if you know the dividends are coming in on a predictable schedule (ends of March, June, September and December) then you can align Norberting your contributions at the same time and then have a single pool of money to buy VTI/VXUS with, as opposed to Norberting over and buying separately from when there is also dividend income to invest with, just to reduce transaction fees and the amount of time you need to spend re-balancing.

I don't think it's unreasonable at all. Canadian equities make up about 1.5% of the world stock market, yet they are something like 25% of XEQT/VEQT. If a Japan 1990 happens to Canada, that's 25% of your portfolio that'll take 2-3 decades to recover from (assuming it does even recover). Even scarier is that there are a lot of Canadians who are 100% in Canadian equities, even concentrating down to Canadian dividend equities. Betting that Canadian equities will perform a certain way forever is no different than betting that a company or a sector will.

Products like XEQT/VEQT really only make sense if you want to hold a home country bias since they do the re-balancing for you and in the process save you a few points in capital gains taxes as opposed to you re-balancing the portfolio yourself. I went through the calculations at the beginning of the year when I switched my portfolio over form VXC/XIC to VTI/VEA/VWO, and I did find that XEQT/VEQT save you money against managing the portfolio yourself, but only if you hold the home-country bias, otherwise it isn't worth it, and you just get into a CAD vs USD ETF debate (higher cost but simpler buying vs more liquidity and Norberting).

I don't do currency-hedging myself. I read up on it a bit, and the consensus seemed to be that a) having at least 30% of your portfolio exposed to other currencies provides protection against currency concentration, and b) no one knows what will happen with currency movements, so the net expected effect is 0, which means if you're paying extra for currency hedging, you're losing performance for no expected long-term predictable gain.

As far as the leverage thing goes, I'd imagine that over long enough periods of time, with nerves made out of adamantium, the more of your equity portfolio you hold leveraged (up to 2-3x), the better you will do. I even think Jack Bogle admitted this in one of his interviews. The problem comes in with how much risk you can, want, and need to take. The Hedgefundie/NTSX thing is a different argument since the risk point is the leveraged treasuries, not the leveraged equities.

I'd model out your leverage position based on your portfolio goals and make a decision that is based on behavioural risk more than anything else. I've never seen a back-test that includes how people in real-life run their portfolios, except one study that showed that supposedly-passive investors consistently under-perform the market average for their allocation because their asset allocation is incorrect for their goals and investing personality, which leads to tweaking and portfolio churn and market timing. Back-tests can tell you the perfect amount of leverage to use, but they can't tell you how you'll react when everything you counted on fails (and it will at some point), they are only theoretical and assume a perfectly rational investor (which none of us are). Instead, I'd model out your portfolio based on capital amounts, contributions, inflation, dividends, withdrawals, and growth, and look at the best and worst case scenarios, the hard numbers. Ask yourself what you can live with in terms of downside and missed upside and triangulate a position between them, and listen to your gut, it knows you better than any chart ever will.",1630051464.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/pbnfva/criticize_my_portfolio/haj5bqm/

Liquidity of some leveraged ETFs can be a problem when trading. But not super serious when holding long term. i.e. no Paper hands. If your plan is to hold long term. Hold.

This time last year, the sub was in ""need to move to cash, stocks are so risky, my risk tolerance was lower than I thought"" spam mode, now we seem to be entering the ""buy 3x leveraged stock ETFs"" spam mode. As Bogle said, ""they were bearish when they should have been bullish, and bullish when they should have been bearish!""

The reasons not to buy 3x leveraged ETFs are mostly based on the fact that they are not built to hold long term. These are funds built for intra-day risk management of hedge funds and the like. They will trend toward zero (and many have gone to zero) in any volatile market due to their structure, and they are overpriced even relative to their fundamentals. It is an inappropriate way to invest, because it takes an ungodly amount of uncompensated risk, and operates as an implicit bet against volatility (which is totally unjustifiable on boglehead or academic finance grounds), all with a 1% per year fee that cripples its future returns in the long run. I guess I will be posting this for a long time, or actually, until the next crash or period of low returns when people will then react in the exact opposite direction.  


PS: 2x leveraged ETFS =/= 2x leverage. Leverage can be good in many circumstances, but not this kind! The best kind is something like having a mortgage on your home and investing rather than paying it off fast.

1. Is the juice worth the squeeze? You are going to go through gut wrenching volatility over several years to make how much? If you make $10k profit (pre-tax) over 3 years is that good? In those 3 years you could easily increase your salary more than 10k through training, schooling, side jobs, etc. So, as long as you can do this passively, sure give it a try. If it is going to consume you tracking the markets and worrying all the time, I would not. If you're doing this with $100k at 22yo, then do whatever you think is best because you're killing it.
2. This could be brutal psychologically. Passive investing is as much a behavioral strategy as a rational investing strategy. Are you going to be able to keep up your strategy during volatile markets for years on end? It's easy to say you won't panic when it's March 2020 again, but harder to do in the moment.
3. It's dangerous to think you can outsmart the market. The #1 Boglehead principle is to earn ""your share of the total market return"". If you are outsmarting the market and earning more than your share, that means someone else is getting crushed. I hope that you'll be on the winning end of that deal.

That being said, you might have better luck in the personal finance sub.

The ""boglehead"" answer is something like:
You're trying to time the market, which is next to impossible.
Leveraged ETFs are requiring you to do things like try to exit and enter the market at the ""right"" time, which is in contradiction of buy and hold. If you do that incorrectly you are going to miss large amounts of potential gains.

I am by no means an expert or familiar enough with those funds or how the market operates at a intimate level to critique your specific strategy opposed to the one laid out by hedgefundie.

>This is not a buy and hold portfolio.

It is exactly that. This is an allocation variation of HEDGEFUNDIE'S Excellent Adventure, which is one of the most discussed and rigorously evaluated threads on the forum. The math and thesis on why this has high opportunity to beat the market (saddled with correspondingly high volatility) has been well demonstrated. It essentially is a wager that the Fed's shift in policy after Greenspan will continue indefinitely and we won't see a return of aggressive rate increases. If you want to dive in, there's somewhere around 200 pages of discussion on the forum. 

Now, I should acknowledge the larger bent of wisdom you were dispensing is entirely accurate. This is not the kind of thing someone should ride as their core retirement strategy. It's the kind of thing you slice off 5% to do as a high risk/reward opportunity, and that's what you'll hear from hedgefundie and everyone else throughout the thread.",1591943252.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/h7dt80/uprotmf_contribution_strategy/fukn52g/
